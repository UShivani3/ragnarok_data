Still, the Psychology practice tests in this article might be helpful resources. You can sort through the free-response questions that were asked on previous administrations of the test to find ones that are relevant to what you've learned so far. It's a smart idea to practice free-response questions well ahead of time because they require the most independent knowledge. Most students have a tougher time on this section than on the multiple-choice section because you don't get a list of options that might jog your memory about a certain term or concept.

Experiments have shown that mental association between expectancy-confirming information and the group label strongly affects recall and recognition memory.

I recommend buying a review book ( 5 Steps to a 5 and Cracking the AP Psychology Exam are the ones I like best). Review books cover just the information you'll need to know for the test, so they are going to be less overwhelming to study than your textbook or notes from class will be. That said, don't totally ignore the resources you've accumulated in your AP Psychology class. Your notes might include unique methods for remembering concepts and terms, which can be useful as an alternative to the information in a review book. Your textbook could be useful as well because it might have diagrams that are better than the ones in review books.

Short-term memories are all the things that you are actively thinking about and aware of at any given moment. This type of memory is both limited and very brief. Estimates suggest that you can probably hold anywhere from 5 to 9 items in short-term memory for approximately 20 to 30 seconds. If this information is actively rehearsed and attended to, it may be moved over into what is known as long-term memory. This type of memory is, as the name suggests, much more durable. While these longer-lasting memories are still susceptible to forgetting, the information retained in your long-term memory can last anywhere from days to decades.

Another study from the American Psychological Association found that conservative Christian parents were slightly more likely to use corporal punishment when disciplining their children, but indicated that children from religious families who stay together may be better adjusted. How Does Religion Decrease Family Cohesion? While many studies have asserted that there is an increase in family cohesion among those with a religion, others have found conflicting results or challenged the qualities that hold these families together. Some studies have also asserted that for individual family members who fall outside the religious norms of the family, such as those who challenge the faith or who are homosexual, this rule of family cohesion no longer applies. Non-Followers Are Outsiders\nA study published in the Review of Religious Research found that when gay or lesbian family members attended a religious family wedding, they perceived themselves to be outsiders rather than part of a cohesive family group. The researchers indicate that conservative religious faith may negatively impact family cohesion when some family members do not conform to standards of that religion and that more liberal and diverse religious groups contribute better to healthy family relationships.

It could be due to poor time management, a careless mistake, or a lack of content knowledge. If one of the first two problems is the source of many of your mistakes, you probably need to take more practice tests to get used to the format while learning to read more carefully and pace yourself better. If your mistakes have more to do with content knowledge, then you can narrow your focus further by categorizing your wrong answers by subject ( consult the list of topics in this article ). This way, you can primarily study parts of the course that you struggle with and avoid wasting time on concepts you already understand. Once you've identified your mistakes on the practice test and taken steps to correct them, take another test to check your progress. Again, make sure you take this test with the same time limits as the real AP test. After you take the second test, repeat the steps of scoring it and looking through your mistakes.

From infancy, every human person has an innate sense that \u201cthere is something more than just me\u201d and a drive to discover what that might be.

This type of counseling is likely to be of interest to people for whom spirituality or religion play a major role in their lives, and who lean into their faith-based values to help them to make decisions, understand suffering, set priorities, and to create purpose and meaning in their lives. What Is Faith-Based Counseling? Faith-based counseling is counseling or therapy that involves a spiritual and/or religious approach. Dependent upon the education and skill-base of the provider, the approach might be entirely religious/spiritual, or it might incorporate and integrate secular psychological theories and interventions as well.

Social theories are generally centered on specific social phenomena, including group behavior, 10 \ufeff prosocial behavior, social influence, love and much more. Why Theories Matter\nIn your psychology courses, you may find yourself questioning how necessary it is to learn about different psychology theories, especially those that are considered inaccurate or outdated. However, all of these theories provide valuable information about the history of psychology, the progression of thought on a particular topic, and a deeper understanding of current theories. By understanding how thinking has progressed, you can get a better idea not only of where psychology has been, but where it might be going in the future. Studying scientific theories can help you make better sense of what researchers mean when they talk about scientific study. It can improve your understanding of how scientific explanations for behavior and other phenomena in the natural world are formed, investigated, and accepted by the scientific community. While debates continues to rage over hot topics, it is worthwhile to study science and the theories that have emerged from such research, even when what is often revealed might come as a harsh or inconvenient truth.

Interestingly, in studies such as this one, the primacy effect (having a better memory for earlier items in a list) still occurs. This finding caused some psychologists to suggest that the primacy effect and recency effect could be due to different processes, and that the recency effect might involve short-term memory. However, other research has suggested that the recency effect may be more complicated than this, and that it may be due to more than just short-term memory processes. The Recency Effect in Social Psychology\nWhile the recency effect has long been studied by psychologists who study memory, social psychologists have also explored whether the ordering of information can affect how we perceive others. As an example, imagine that your friend is describing someone they want to introduce you to, and they describe this person as kind, smart, generous, and boring. Because of the recency effect, the last item on the list\u2014boring\u2014might have a disproportionate effect on your judgment of the person, and you might have a less positive impression of them (compared to if boring had been in the middle of the list of words). As Simon Laham and Joseph Forgas explain, we can experience a recency effect or a primacy effect (where the adjectives presented first have a stronger impact), depending on the circumstances. For example, we\u2019re more likely to experience a recency effect if we\u2019re given a long list of information about the person, or if we\u2019re asked to form an impression of the person right after we\u2019re given information about them. On the other hand, we\u2019d be more strongly impacted by the first items in a list if we know in advance that we\u2019re going to be asked to form an impression of the person.", "start_char": 3519, "end_char": 5382}}]}

As social psychologists, we have to distinguish  between the informational function of memory -- how memories  represent our knowledge of the past -- and the communicative function of memory -- how individuals use memory to establish,  maintain, and manage their relations with other people. Social Influences on Memory\nSocial psychology is conventionally defined as the  study of social influence -- that is, how the presence and  activities of other people influence the individual's  experience, thought, and action. This is quite wrong: social psychology is no more the study of social influence than  perception is the study of stimulus influence.

This is slightly contrasted with morality, which is more or less the same thing, but is not concerned with law or enforcement, but with a more general idea of right and wrong. For example, whereas lying may be considered immoral, only lying in certain circumstances, such as on a contract, would be considered unethical. An ethical principal is the foundation thought or idea that makes an ethical standard correct. It is usually the principal on which a law or set of laws is based. For instance, the United States Constitution states some of the reasons why it was written, and as such imply or explicitly declare primary values, with which we can then derive some ethical principles: \u201cin order to form a more perfect Union\u201d - implying that unity of purpose is a primary value.", "start_char": 887, "end_char": 2527}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_13_681731378#0_1540919393", "score": 13.1227, "doc": {"url": "https://brainly.com/question/10941811", "title": "How does Antigone's action as a rebel reveal the universal theme?

Both appeal to consequences in the application of their first principle to the derivation of duties, Kant in considering the consequences of a maxim's becoming a universal law of nature and Mill in considering the consequences of a certain kind of action (e.g. lying). The following similarities were noted by members of the class: Both appeal to rationality to evaluate morality, in the sense that they reason from a fundamental principle about what is morally right or wrong. Both recognize the existing of a \"moral sense\", although neither regards it as the basis of morality (unlike the 18th century Scottish moral sense theorists).

Every Theistic system, regardless of its specifics, asserts that there is a transcendent God who has determined what is right and wrong and has, in some way, revealed that information to mankind. Ethics and morality are understood to be based on that revelation. Whatever God has revealed to be right is right, and anything that runs contrary to that is considered wrong.

Lying is bad because a generally truthful world is a good thing: lying diminishes trust between human beings: if people generally didn't tell the truth, life would become very difficult, as nobody could be trusted and nothing you heard or read could be trusted - you would have to find everything out for yourself\nan untrusting world is also bad for liars - lying isn't much use if everyone is doing it\nLying is bad because it treats those who are lied to as a means to achieve the liar's purpose, rather than as a valuable end in themselves\nMany people think that it is wrong to treat people as means not ends\nLying is bad because it makes it difficult for the person being lied to make a free and informed decision about the matter concerned\nLies lead people to base their decisions on false information\nLying is bad because it cannot sensibly be made into a universal principle\nMany people think that something should only be accepted as an ethical rule if it can be applied in every case\nLying is bad because it's a basic moral wrong\nSome things are fundamentally bad - lying is one of them\nLying is bad because it's something that Good People don't do\nGood behaviour displays the virtues found in Good People\nLying is bad because it corrupts the liar\nTelling lies may become a habit and if a person regularly indulges in one form of wrong-doing they may well become more comfortable with wrong-doing in general\nSome religious people argue Lying is bad because it misuses the God-given gift of human communication\nGod gave humanity speech so that they could accurately share their thoughts - lying does the opposite\nSome philosophers say lying is bad because language is essential to human societies and carries the obligation to use it truthfully\nWhen people use language they effectively 'make a contract' to use it in a particular way - one of the clauses of this contract is not to use language deceitfully\nWhat harm do lies do?

His one wavering comes at the end of the play when he begs John, Martha, and Elizabeth to give false testimony in order to save their lives. This is against both his principles and biblical principles, his one moment of wavering in the face of his human empathy for these innocent souls. Hale does not change in his faith in God, he certainly loses his naivety in regards to putting his confidence in religious authorities.

Examples of exceptions in practice: We may commonly agree that telling the truth is an important positive value, and that conversely deception is inherently wrong. But we make both abstract and situational exceptions for circumstances where we may assert that lying is acceptable behavior. Thus lying to avoid causing another person pain as a general rule would be considered an abstract exception, while lying in a particular situation because a specific person, if lied to, might do a specific thing at a specific time would be considered a situational exception. People may agree that stealing is wrong, but some people may believe that stealing if you are starving and want to feed yourself and your loved ones is more acceptable than stealing if you are a habitual thief who makes a living stealing from people, or if you are an already wealthy person whose greed leads you to steal from your partners, your investors, or those you do business with.

But since even the best of us (including Paul) are fallen sinners, it is an imperfect and somewhat uncertain process at best. But even when we miss God\u2019s will due to our dim sight or sin, He is sovereign and gracious to overcome our mistakes. The uncertainty of this process is revealed in the difference of opinion between godly scholars over whether Paul was right or wrong to go to Jerusalem. The Holy Spirit had repeatedly revealed to Paul that he would encounter \u201cbonds and afflictions\u201d if he went there (20:23). Some commentators, such as Donald Barnhouse, Ray Stedman, and James Boice, argue (in light of 21:4) that Paul was either deliberately sinning or making a foolish mistake to continue his journey in light of these warnings. Others (the majority of those that I read) argue that Paul was right and that those who pled with him not to go were wrong. But our text and the history of Paul in Acts reveal some principles on how to discern God\u2019s will: We should walk so closely with God that we discern His guidance as we live in obedience to His Word, in dependence on His Holy Spirit. With that as a brief summary, I want to work through seven principles for discerning God\u2019s will, some of which are in our text, and others which come from Paul\u2019s walk with God.", "start_char": 3684, "end_char": 5130}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_36_595248024#6_1194815672", "score": 11.7401, "doc": {"url": "https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/e/an-essay-concerning-human-understanding/summary-and-analysis/book-i-innate-ideas", "title": "Innate Ideas", "headings": "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nJohn Locke\nSummary and Analysis Book I:  Innate Ideas\n", "segment": "If it does not appear until after the instruction, there is not only a possibility, but a very strong probability, that it has been derived from the instruction.

Since the principles under discussion fail to meet both of these tests, this is further evidence that they are not innate. Having shown that speculative principles are not innate, Locke next gives his attention to practical or moral principles. It should be somewhat easier to show that these are not innate because there are no moral rules to which people give their assent so readily or so universally as they do the principles included in the laws of thought. There were, however, in Locke's day many scholars of repute who defended the idea that the principles of right and wrong are implanted in the human mind by God, and hence they are innate rather than being derived from human experience. Locke attempts to show there is no evidence that lends support to this theory. This does not mean that he rejects the belief that there are valid principles or rules for distinguishing right from wrong, but he does deny that there is any sound basis for regarding them as innate.

Bentham argues that if utility is defined as the ability to produce happiness, then the rightness of an action is determined by its utility. Bentham also argues that if happiness is viewed as the only thing which is intrinsically good, then the principle of utility is the only right principle of human action. Bentham advocates a doctrine of psychological hedonism, that all human actions are motivated by the desire to enjoy pleasure or prevent pain, and that the enjoyment of pleasure or the avoidance of pain is the only rational aim of human action. He also advocates a doctrine of ethical hedonism, that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by whether the action tends to promote happiness or unhappiness. If an action conforms to the principle of utility (i.e. if the action tends to promote happiness or prevent unhappiness), then the action is morally right, or at least is not morally wrong. If an action does not conform to the principle of utility (i.e. if the action tends to prevent happiness or promote unhappiness), then the action is morally wrong, or at least is not morally right. Bentham maintains that the principle of utility is the only sufficient ground for deciding whether an action is morally right or wrong. The principle of sympathy and antipathy (i.e. the feeling of instinctive approval or disapproval for the expected consequences of an action) is not a sufficient ground for judging the moral rightness or wrongness of an action.

Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgments against others, because the imperatives on which they are based rely too heavily on subjective considerations.

Creonte, king of Tebas after Polynices and Eteocles killed each other for the throne, forbids the funeral rites to Polyneices. Antigone, his sister, carries them on anyway because the human laws can't prevail over God's laws.

The most basic formulation of the categorical imperative is Kant\u2019s principle of universal law\u2014which states that only a maxim that can be consistently universalized can qualify as a moral law. Whereas the golden rule also employs a requirement of universalizability, Kant\u2019s approach is different in that his formula does not appeal to what people want but rather requires rational consistency. To determine whether or not a given act is morally right, we must (1) formulate the maxim that the act falls under, (2) universalize that maxim, and (3) determine if the universalized maxim generates inconsistency. If there is no inconsistency, then the universalized maxim violates no moral law; if there is inconsistency, then the act is morally wrong.

The spirit (\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7) which inspired these prophets as a lying spirit is neither Satan, nor any evil spirit whatever, but, as the definite article and the whole of the context show, the personified spirit of prophecy, which is only so far a \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u0342\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b1\u0313\u03ba\u03b1\u0301\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u0342\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 ( Zechariah 13:2; 1 John 4:6) and under the influence of Satan as it works as \u05e9\u05c1\u05e7\u05e8 \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7 in accordance with the will of God.

Jehovah sends this spirit, inasmuch as the deception of Ahab has been inflicted upon him as a judgment of God for his unbelief. But there is no statement here to the effect that this lying spirit proceeded from Satan, because the object of the prophet was simply to bring out the working of God in the deception practised upon Ahab by his prophets. - The words of Jehovah, \"Persuade Ahab, thou wilt be able,\" and \"Jehovah has put a lying spirit,\" etc.,", "start_char": 7409, "end_char": 9374}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_35_1180728553#5_2737639062", "score": 11.4807, "doc": {"url": "https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/calumny-and-detraction.html", "title": "Calumny and detraction", "headings": "Calumny and detraction\nCalumny and detraction\nAcknowledgement\nThe Author\n", "segment": "Many Catholics seem to be unaware of the fact that detraction is also a sin \u2014 a sin contrary to the Eighth Commandment.

Work hard\nKeep your word\nRespect others\nObey the law\nAppreciate the people who help and support you\nTake responsibility for your actions, including your mistakes\nDon't discriminate; treat people fairly\nThe Unethical Workplace\nSome types of unethical behavior, such as lying, stealing or cheating, are wrong on or off the job.", "start_char": 0, "end_char": 1299}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_1266895927#1_2665950792", "score": 11.2902, "doc": {"url": "https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/natural-law-basic-principles-objections-and-responses/", "title": "Natural Law: Basic Principles, Objections, and Responses", "headings": "Natural Law: Basic Principles, Objections, and Responses\nBLOGS\n: Justin Taylor\nNatural Law: Basic Principles, Objections, and Responses\nBasic Principles of Natural-Law Thought\nObjections to Natural Law and Responses\n", "segment": "Basic Principles of Natural-Law Thought\nNatural law is an eternal moral law revealed to all people through human nature.

Moral requirements determine what it is to respond properly to the value of persons as rational agents. The distinctive value of human life lies in the human capacity to assess reasons and justifications. Therefore, appreciating the value of a person involves recognising her capacity to appreciate and act on reasons. The way to value this capacity is to treat persons in accord with principles they could not reasonably reject. In doing so, the agent is guided by a principle that can rightly be characterised as one that the person herself authorised that agent to be guided by, in thinking about the appropriate way to relate to her. Contractualism illuminates the compelling Kantian insight that we ought to treat persons never as mere means but always as ends in themselves. It interprets this as treating them according to principles they could not reasonably reject. 2.

The more generalized the exception, the more useful it is in a wider context for defining a consistent value system. In general, abstract exceptions serve to reinforce the prioritization of values, e.g.: Lying is wrong, but lying to save someone else's life is acceptable, because preserving a human life is more valuable (more highly valued) than the adhering to the principle that lying is wrong. In a formal value system (idealized or realized), the default exception associated with each value is assumed to be \"as long as no higher-priority value is violated\".

It's much harder to create compelling content marketing, for example, if you don\u2019t know why it would be compelling to your audience in the first place. Before you jump into the tactical nitty-gritty of marketing, it\u2019s really helpful to understand how people operate \u2026 which is essentially what the entire field of psychology attempts to explain. Understanding some key principles of psychology can take your marketing from good to amazing, all because the right audience is reading and identifying with it (and most likely converting on it, too).

Locke attempts to show there is no evidence that lends support to this theory. This does not mean that he rejects the belief that there are valid principles or rules for distinguishing right from wrong, but he does deny that there is any sound basis for regarding them as innate. The usual argument given in support of the belief that moral principles are innate is that there is universal agreement concerning them. Everyone knows, it is argued, that it is wrong to lie, to steal, and to do various other things. The awareness that these actions are wrong is said to precede any reflection or thinking about them and hence they must be innate. To this argument, Locke replies that there is no universal agreement about the rightness or wrongness of any particular action. It may appear that such agreement exists if practically everyone believes that it is wrong for a person intentionally to violate his agreements or to act unjustly in his dealings with his fellow humans.

The Bible says that it testifies to God's existence.", "start_char": 4796, "end_char": 5586}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_19_1242709138#3_1855649991", "score": 11.1637, "doc": {"url": "https://ew.com/article/2015/03/29/once-upon-time-reveals-what-happened-maleficents-child/", "title": "'Once Upon a Time' reveals what happened to Maleficent's child | EW.com", "headings": "'Once Upon a Time' reveals what happened to Maleficent's child\n'Once Upon a Time' reveals what happened to Maleficent's child\nEpisode Recaps\nOnce Upon a Time\n", "segment": "Episode 16 does show their connection, which is [Lily\u2019s] carrying around Emma\u2019s darkness and Emma is carrying around her lightness,\u201d he says. \u201c Even in that moment when the parents take her away, they\u2019ve connected them forever.\u201d While Lily didn\u2019t appear to be too dark of a child when she initially crossed paths with Emma, years have passed and much could have changed. \u201c When we met Lily, she didn\u2019t seem like a bad person, but she was lying to Emma,\u201d Kitsis points out. \u201c Lying came second nature to her.

Pupil dilation is simply an indication of physiological arousal. The pressure of trying to pass off a lie causes a general stress response in many people, thus leading to adrenaline release, which causes pupil dilation. Hence it sometimes being used as a part of a lie detection protocol. Remember, if someone's pupils are dilated, that doesn't mean they are lying - they could just as easily have knocked down an espresso, be really excited about the topic, or even be afraid that you think they're lying when they're not. Context and other indicators are very important.", "start_char": 194, "end_char": 1184}}, {"docid": "msmarco_v2.1_doc_36_663579529#1_1338604598", "score": 11.1497, "doc": {"url": "https://www.cmf.org.uk/resources/publications/content/?context=article&id=1330", "title": "Ethical Principles from the Bible", "headings": "Ethical Principles from the Bible\nEthical Principles from the Bible\n1.
