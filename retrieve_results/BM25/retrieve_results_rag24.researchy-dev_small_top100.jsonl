The aim and purpose of a team is to perform, get results, and achieve victory in the workplace. The best managers are those who can gather together a group of individuals and mold them into an effective team. The key properties of a true team include collaborative action where, along with a common goal, teams have collaborative tasks. Conversely, in a group, individuals are responsible only for their own area. They also share the rewards of strong team performance with their compensation based on shared outcomes. Compensation of individuals must be based primarily on a shared outcome, not individual performance. Members are also willing to sacrifice for the common good in which individuals give up scarce resources for the common good instead of competing for those resources. For example, teams occur in sports such as soccer and basketball, in which the individuals actively help each other, forgo their own chance to score by passing the ball, and win or lose collectively as a team.

Its roots lie in systems theory, the study of phenomena as systems of interrelated parts. This model was developed through an empirical study of family communication over 35 years ago and has evolved and expanded over time an application to families, couples, teams and whole organizations. Kantor's Structural Dynamics is broadly applicable because most of the “work” of human systems and the decisions made there take place in face to face discourse. Communicative competency – the understanding of the structure of face to face communications in human systems – is the key to sound decision making and to creating results. David Kantor’s theory of Structural Dynamics provides compelling insight into how individual and teams can operate more effectively together. His structural model of communication, used for decades by psychologists, organizational development professionals, and interventionists, is now available through this suite of instruments and is described in his groundbreaking publication, Reading the Room. Because the theory links individuals‘ profiles with observable external behaviors, it provides an actionable perspective on how to improve communication outcomes in all settings. Rather than describing an individual’s profile as a static entity, these instruments provide coaching on how to expand the behavioral repertoire, manage reactions in high stakes settings and find organizations that are the best fit for the individual.

The performance of a group consists of the inputs of the group minus any process losses such as the quality of a product, ramp-up time to production, or the sales for a given month.","start_char":373,"end_char":1392}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_52_1126772962#3_2242768176","score":11.2422,"doc":{"url":"https://www.smartsheet.com/all-about-team-assessments","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Team Assessments | Smartsheet","headings":"Everything You Need to Know About Team Assessments\nEverything You Need to Know About Team Assessments\nSmartsheet Contributor Becky Simon on  Jul 28, 2017\nTeams vs. Groups and Why Teamwork Rules\nSee how Smartsheet can help you be more effective\nWhat Are the Hallmarks of a Strong Team?\nUse Team Assessments to Uncover Performance Issues\nUnderstanding the Roles People Play on Teams\nAssessments and the Stages of Team Development\nAssessing How Your Team Executes: The Z Process\nWhen To Do a Team Assessment\nWhat Can You Evaluate With A Team Assessment?\nUsing Team Assessment Tools for Enhancing Vision\nThe Role of Team Assessments in Managing Conflict\nThe Benefits of Assessments for Team Member Development\nUnderstanding and Collaboration in Team Assessments\nThe “Five Dysfunctions” Team Assessment Model\nHow to Act Against the Five Dysfunctions\nBecome More Willing to Engage in Productive Conflict\nIncrease Commitment\nPractice Accountability\nIncrease the Focus on Results\nThe Five Behaviors of a Cohesive Team\nChoosing an Assessment For Your Team\nPersonality and Behavioral Style Assessments\nLeadership Assessments\nTeam Assessments\nTools to Help New Teams Build Trust\nTools for Building Team Understanding\nDIY Team Assessment Tools\nThe Pros’ Top Tips on Using Team Assessments\nAssessment Tools for Healthcare and Science\nHow to Get the Most From Your Team Assessment\nTrack Team Assessment Outcomes and Goals in Smartsheet\n","segment":"Most importantly, teams are characterized by synergy, the combination of individual efforts to create a team effort that is greater than the sum of the individual efforts. Simply put, teams do things that groups can’t. That’s vital for organizations, which typically have goals stretching far beyond individual capabilities. Organizational success is built on effective teamwork. Teams need to be built; they are not automatically fully formed and functional. That’s not to say teams can’t be created organically, but the best teams usually have members picked to fill specific roles or functions (to create synergy). Ensure that teammates complement each other and build relationships that allow them to do this most effectively. Teammates can complement each other in terms of skills, diversity of perspectives, personalities, thinking styles, experiences, training, and social abilities.

For change management teams, an individual change model like the ADKAR Model enables them to collect data from different groups across the organization to 1) understand how effective their organizational change management activities have been and 2) take corrective action. For example, if the team identifies low awareness of the need for change, they can adjust the communication plans and sponsor plans to correct this situation. If, on the other hand, knowledge and ability are low, they can adjust the training and coaching plans.

How can organizations foster cross-team collaboration while maintaining necessary job differentiation? While team members within different areas of the organization might not work together on a day-to-day basis, it’s important that the managers of these separate teams do. Weekly leadership meetings can help many organizations to keep each team informed of what other departments are working on. Especially with larger organizations, discussions of company goals during these meetings can also help managers decide how to best share and divide up work among departments—which gives team members unique opportunities to collaborate. Sometimes silos can develop because of differences in opinion or barriers between department leaders over priorities. This is another thing that can be alleviated with open and honest meetings—as opposed to just one or two executives being the only people who really know what’s happening company-wide. Harness Individual Skills For A Collective & Collaborative Win\nMeaningful creative collaboration between employees with various skill sets is another great way to facilitate long-term communication and alleviate the effects of a silo.

Since states have flexibility in how they implement transition, these teams reflect the diversity of each state and its goals. An optimal state team includes a wide range of representatives from state organizations as well as professionals, family members, and individuals with disabilities. Whether a team is convened for local or state-level transition purposes, to be successful it must have individuals with a vested interest in the transition outcomes of youth with disabilities. Stakeholders from agencies who have an active role in transition and who can also identify the transition needs of youth with disabilities – both those needs that are being met, and those that are unmet – are a good place to begin recruitment. Soliciting recommendations from all those contacted might be useful, as well as raising the question at early team meetings.

While team applications are the most popular uses of the tool, Team Analysis is capable of assessing an unlimited number of individuals. As a result, it enables our clients to perform various, more complicated analyses very cost effectively. Some of these applications include identification of the effective behaviors (leadership, management, sales and customer service), succession planning and strategic decision making.

A group is simply a loose organization of people who coordinate their efforts. A team, by contrast, is a collection of people with shared goals who are bound by their commitment to reach these goals. They share a common purpose, and they regulate their behavior and performance to fulfill this purpose. Since teammates share goals, they also hold each other accountable while pursuing these goals, and they have to be good communicators. Most importantly, teams are characterized by synergy, the combination of individual efforts to create a team effort that is greater than the sum of the individual efforts.

Further, a signed acknowledgment of job responsibilities should typically be required at the start of employment to ensure employees understand, acknowledge, and are held accountable for their roles within the organization — all of which helps strengthen an organization’s overall internal control environment. Further, not only should security job descriptions be documented and known to key personnel, but they should be updated as needed and often reinforced. This will allow management to accurately set performance measures, incentives, and/or other rewards appropriate for responsibilities in the organization reflecting appropriate conduct and performance. Lastly, properly documented security role job descriptions strongly influence the design of your internal control framework and increase the likelihood that they will operate effectively. What is an Information Security Organizational Chart and How is it Used? A clearly defined organizational chart should outline the structure of an organization’s staff, typically starting with an outline of the C-level staff, followed by the structure of those that report into those C-level roles. The purpose of this chart is to create a straightforward depiction of an organization’s hierarchy, which allows employees to understand lines of authority, relationships between other individuals in the organization, and who they need to report to when issues arise. Organizational charts can outline the reporting structure and hierarchy of an entire organization, or they can be developed for individual functional teams, which would typically occur in mid to large organizations. An example of a functional team organizational chart would be one that is developed specifically to outline an Information Security team structure.","start_char":3539,"end_char":5879}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_58_679236765#0_887191005","score":10.9212,"doc":{"url":"https://www.windowscentral.com/how-hard-mute-people-microsoft-teams","title":"How to fully hard-mute people in Microsoft Teams | Windows Central","headings":"How to fully hard-mute people in Microsoft Teams\nHow to fully hard-mute people in Microsoft Teams\nVPN Deals: Lifetime license for $16, monthly plans at $1 & more\nHow to disable unmute for attendees during a meeting on Microsoft Teams\nAllow attendees to unmute during a meeting\nAllow individual attendee to unmute during a meeting\nHow to disable unmute for attendees before meeting on Microsoft Teams\nReview: The TravelMate Spin P4 is built strong but falls behind competitors\nMass Effect Legendary Edition revitalizes Mass Effect 1 with love and care\nHow to pick the best XPS 13 configuration for your needs\nThese are the best PC sticks when you're on the move\n","segment":"How to fully hard-mute people in Microsoft Teams | Windows Central\nWe may earn a commission for purchases using our links.

Often, teams within the police can be more efficient and more effective than individual officers and detectives working solo or in a vacuum. When police departments apply team building in the police force to unite against organized and systemic crime, they can better utilize available resources to keep the public safe. Single Unit Teams\nOne of the most efficient and effective teams within a police department is a SWAT team. Its sole purpose is to handle situations that are dangerous or require special training and equipment. SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams are small groups of highly skilled individuals who train together on a regular basis. Unlike most other teams within the department, their assignments are very specific and have very clear goals in mind, such as rescuing hostages at a dangerous location, according to Rasmussen University. Team members must work in unison to ensure the success of the mission. Single Purpose Teams\nSingle-purpose teams within a police force might include the vice division, which is dedicated to stopping crimes such as pornography, gambling and prostitution. The vice squad might create even smaller teams to go after an even more specific group or individual, such as a drug dealer in a certain neighborhood.","start_char":0,"end_char":1615}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_52_1129249337#9_2246462952","score":10.9051,"doc":{"url":"https://www.smartsheet.com/content/crisis-management-team-roles","title":"How to Build a Crisis Management Team l Smartsheet","headings":"How to Build an Effective Crisis Management Team\nHow to Build an Effective Crisis Management Team\nSmartsheet Contributor Andy Marker on  May 13, 2020\nWhat Is a Crisis Management Team?\nSee how Smartsheet can help you be more effective\nThe Purpose of a Crisis Management Team\nCrisis Management Roles and Responsibilities\nTeam Structure in Incident Command System of Crisis Management\nThe Role of the Crisis Manager\nCrisis Management Team Roles\nAttributes of Crisis Management Team Members\nWhat Role Should the CEO Play in Crisis Management?\nCrisis Management Team Checklist\nCrisis Management Team Planning Checklist\nCrisis Management Team Checklist: First Response by Role\nHow Crisis Management Teams Adapt to Multiple Locations\nCrisis Team Hierarchy in Multisite/Multinational Organizations\nCrisis Management Support Teams\nCulture and Mindset Problems that Defeat the Crisis Management Team\nExperts Troubleshoot Most Common Crisis Management Team Problems\nMaster Remote Crisis Management with Real-Time Work Management in Smartsheet\n","segment":"Hold drills and rehearsals of the revised plan across the organization.

In a large crisis management team, an individual may be in charge of each area of responsibility, but members of smaller teams may fill more than one role. Typically, individuals represent the area of the organization in which they normally work, so they bring their operational knowledge to the crisis management team. During normal operations, many departments often have teams that deal with problems.

The company hired Scott Edmonds as president, and 2 years later revenues had almost doubled from $378 million to $760 million.

He created a horizontal organization with high-performance teams that were empowered with decision-making ability and accountability for results. The use of teams also began to increase because advances in technology have resulted in more complex systems that require contributions from multiple people across the organization.

Psychological safety in the workplace means that you feel comfortable taking risks for your team's success, and that you don't feel that you will be disciplined or berated for taking those risks.","start_char":0,"end_char":1461}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_18_1363256607#0_1533063100","score":10.8753,"doc":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_motivation","title":"Public service motivation - Wikipedia","headings":"Public service motivation\nPublic service motivation\nContents\nCommon Models\nHow Public Service Motivation (PSM) is Used\nPerry’s Public Service Motivation Scale\nMission Valence\nTransformational Leadership\nThe Role of Organizations in Promoting PSM\nStudies\nFields\nFormulation\nFactors\nCriticism and Alternatives\nLeadership Practices\nSurface Acting\nEmotional Labor\nEmployment Relationship\nSee also\nNotes and references\n","segment":"Public service motivation - Wikipedia\nPublic service motivation\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nPublic Service Motivation ( PSM) is an attribute of government and non-governmental organization ( NGO) employment that explains why individuals have a desire to serve the public and link their personal actions with the overall public interest. Understanding the theory and practice of PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for more financially lucrative careers in the private sector.

Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as how those that do work in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team's success and productivity. Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards. Perry’s Public Service Motivation Scale\nPublic Service Motivation serves to provide the general public with an idea of what motivates individuals to choose career paths within the public sector as opposed to the private.","start_char":0,"end_char":2740}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_26_695006814#1_1321560461","score":10.8712,"doc":{"url":"https://powerofted.com/","title":"Power of TED* – Escape the Drama Triangle","headings":"Transform Everyday Drama in Work & Life\nTransform Everyday Drama in Work & Life\n“The Empowerment Triangle is a highly original and effective escape from the Drama Triangle .”\n—Stephen Karpman, M.D., originator of the Karpman Drama Triangle\nTransform workplace drama and say goodbye to business-as-usual with our facilitated online course, tailored for you and your team.\n3 Vital Questions Coaching Course: Transform Drama to Design Your Dreams\nWhat Can We Help You Find?\nAbout TED*\nTraining Options\nSelf-Paced eCourse\nBooks\nAbout TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic)\nTraining Options\nFor Organizations\nFor Work Teams\nFor Coaches\nFor Individuals\nBooks\nDavid Emerald Womeldorff\nAbout the Author\nTestimonials\n","segment":"—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love\nAbout TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic)\nThe Power of TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic) ® is a tool for both individuals and organizations who want to create more effective communication and relationships.

However, there is no empirical research evidence that these new industry trends work and experts have advised HR professionals to adhere to sound psychological principles that inform effective appraisal systems (Rotolo et al., 2018). These psychological principles include the need for feedback on performance and the ability to have voice in the process. While it is true that performance appraisal ratings do have limitations such as rater bias, there are also benefits to implementing or improving a performance appraisal system that relies on ratings (Adler et al., 2015).

Agile teams can be organized around services, products, or features where you have multiple individuals that interact with shared functionality.

These cross-functional Agile teams will allow your organization to produce work in an organized way that delivers higher output than non-Agile teams. Agile teams should be created strategically to ensure that each role on the team is well thought out and necessary. Team members should be set up for success in their roles and clearly understand how their contributions will help lead the team to delivering successful results.

Because the theory links individuals‘ profiles with observable external behaviors, it provides an actionable perspective on how to improve communication outcomes in all settings. Rather than describing an individual’s profile as a static entity, these instruments provide coaching on how to expand the behavioral repertoire, manage reactions in high stakes settings and find organizations that are the best fit for the individual.

In 2001, clothing retailer Chico’s FAS was looking to grow its business. The company hired Scott Edmonds as president, and two years later revenues had almost doubled from $378 million to $760 million. By 2006, revenues were $1.6 billion, and Chico’s had nine years of double-digit same-store sales growth. What did Edmonds do to get these results? He created a horizontal organization “ruled by high-performance teams with real decision-making clout and accountability for results, rather than by committees that pass decisions up to the next level or toss them over the wall into the nearest silo.” The use of teams also began to increase because advances in technology have resulted in more complex systems that require contributions from multiple people across the organization.

To keep members motivated, there needs to be an individual component to the incentive system but, as Larson encourages, reviews should be more heavily weighted based on the performance of the team. “At the end of the day, you don’t want people to become lone rangers,” Larson says. “ You want the primary focus to be on achieving the team goal.” Research supports that approach: Incentivized teams increase their performance by 45 percent, compared to incentivized individuals, who increase their performance by only 27 percent, according to the International Society for Performance Improvement and the Incentive Research Foundation. 5.

Studies have found that an employee’s preference for the type of feedback they receive — positive versus negative (or constructive) — may vary according to their experience level. While positive feedback can be a confidence booster, negative feedback may be more valuable to employees with higher levels of proficiency looking to step up their game. One fact is certain: Meaningful employee feedback increases employee engagement. In fact, according to a Gallup report, employees would prefer to receive negative feedback than no feedback at all. An employee who is ignored by a manager is twice as likely to be actively disengaged at work as an employee whose manager focuses on his or her weaknesses, according to the report.

Typically, individuals represent the area of the organization in which they normally work, so they bring their operational knowledge to the crisis management team. During normal operations, many departments often have teams that deal with problems. In an organizational crisis, this team becomes a subteam of the crisis management team and reports to the individual in the related role. For example, IT departments generally have a group that responds to outages or other urgent technical problems as part of their normal routine. In a major emergency that affects the whole organization, this group activates as part of the crisis response, with the IT member in charge. Regina Phelps is the founder of crisis management consulting firm Emergency Management & Safety Solutions, whose clients have included Microsoft, Duke University, and Airbnb.

Getting everyone to work together while playing by the same rules and reaching for the same goals is a challenge. Each team member will always be at a different professional level, and therefore their functional priorities may vary. The challenge is to translate the collective goals and objectives of the team in order to understand what direction management must go in to enable their team’s success. Then the management team can work backward from their business goals to reach the team’s group and individual performance requirements. By approaching the team in this manner, you’ll allow for an effectively aligned management team and workforce.

Team building can include the daily interaction that employees engage in when working together to carry out the requirements of their jobs. This form of team building is natural and can be assisted if the group takes the time to come up with a set of team norms.

The use of teams also began to increase because advances in technology have resulted in more complex systems that require contributions from multiple people across the organization. Overall, team-based organizations have more motivation and involvement, and teams can often accomplish more than individuals (Cannon-Bowers & Salas, 2001). It is no wonder organizations are relying on teams more and more. It is important to keep in mind that teams are not a cure-all for organizations. To determine whether a team is needed, organizations should consider whether a variety of knowledge, skills, and abilities are needed, whether ideas and feedback are needed from different groups within the organization, how interdependent the tasks are, if wide cooperation is needed to get things done, and whether the organization would benefit from shared goals (Rees, 1997).

Introduction\nPay or employee compensation is a topic that generates considerable interest among scholars and practitioners. Over the years, they have asked questions like how important is money in motivation, to what degree do organizations pay for performance (especially individual performance), does paying for performance contribute to higher performance or does paying for performance (again, especially individual performance) sometimes have undesired (and often unanticipated) consequences? The present paper will focus on pay for individual performance (PFIP) and will offer a selective survey that builds on classic work, but primarily highlights recent conceptual and empirical developments. 1 In particular, the present paper will demonstrate how taking fuller account of sorting effects, the effect that PFIP has “on the composition (e.g., in terms of ability, personality) of an organization's workforce via attraction, selection, and attrition processes” ( Gerhart & Rynes, 2003, p. 151), can change thinking regarding PFIP's effects in several arenas. To begin, we classify pay for performance programs on three dimensions ( Gerhart & Rynes, 2003 ): the emphasis on results-oriented (e.g., physical production output, sales, profits, total shareholder return) or behavior-oriented performance (e.g., supervisor or customer ratings of specific behaviors) measures, the emphasis on performance measured at the individual employee or aggregate (e.g., group, unit, organization) level, and the degree of incentive intensity. Virtually all private sector organizations in the United States (and in many other countries) use multiple pay for performance plans with the design (see the preceding three dimensions) varying as a function of factors such as job level, type of occupation, the way the work is organized, and the organization's strategy ( Gerhart, 2000, Gomez-Mejia and Balkin, 1992 Gomez-Mejia et al., 2010, Milkovich et al., 2013 ).","start_char":653,"end_char":2909}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_40_1020338691#20_2123910698","score":10.7245,"doc":{"url":"https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/team-management/","title":"6 Essential Tips for Effective Team Management in 2021  | The Blueprint","headings":"6 Strategies for Effective Team Management\n6 Strategies for Effective Team Management\nOverview: What is team management?\n6 strategies for effective team management\n1.

However, to be ready to lead in this type of warfare, we must adopt a few strategies. First, we need to understand that while large-scale combat operations and limited contingency operations are different, they should not be viewed as completely separate and distinct.

On his return, Beckwith presented a detailed report highlighting the U.S. Army's vulnerability in not having an SAS-type unit. U.S. Army Special Forces in that period focused on unconventional warfare, but Beckwith recognized the need for \"not only teachers, but doers.\" He envisioned highly adaptable and completely autonomous small teams with a broad array of special skills for direct action and counter-terrorism missions. He briefed military and government figures, who were resistant to creating a new unit outside of Special Forces or changing existing methods. Finally, in the mid-1970s, as the threat of terrorism grew, The Pentagon and Army senior leadership appointed Beckwith to form the unit. Beckwith estimated that it would take 24 months to get his new unit mission-ready. Beckwith's estimate came from a conversation he had had earlier with Brigadier John Watts while in England in 1976.

They are on the same spectrum of conflict. We should not be ready for one or the other; we should be ready for both. Second, mission command as a warfighting function needs to be abandoned by the Army. It is confusing. Command and control is what a staff should be focused on in order to give the commander an accurate visualization so he can command his unit. Mission command is a philosophy and a basic fundamental method for how we lead in combat, not a warfighting function. Third, leaders must be scholars of history in order to ensure they are ready for large-scale combat operations.

Soldiers will follow a good leader anywhere and under any conditions of battle. While many factors decide the outcomes of battles, leadership is often the most important. Military history provides countless examples of battles that were won or lost because of leadership. In times of peace we can also find examples of how exceptional leadership and vision prepared our Army to adapt during times of war. Studying military leadership, allows us to examine the Characterof past leaders, mature our Intellect, Developourselves and others, and Lead our organizations to Achieve results in both training and in combat. In short, the experiences of others can help us develop our own idealized view of leadership in combat. Military Leadership\n\"The discipline which makes the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment. On the contrary, such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make an army. It is possible to impart instruction and to give commands in such a manner and such a tone of voice to inspire the soldier no feeling but an intense desire to obey, while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentment and a desire to disobey.","start_char":0,"end_char":1751}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_1446148193#0_3061608487","score":12.0535,"doc":{"url":"https://www.theleadermaker.com/leadership-attributes-of-special-forces/","title":"Leadership Attributes of Special Forces |","headings":"Leadership Attributes of Special Forces\nLeadership Attributes of Special Forces","segment":"Leadership Attributes of Special Forces |\nLeadership Attributes of Special Forces\nBy Douglas R.

The U.S. Marine Corps conducts a hands-on training course at their Mountain Warfare Training Center on the military use of large animals in difficult terrain. Leadership means thinking beyond the obvious solutions and in this case the need for low-tech solutions in a complex world. About the same time this was going on, there was a special operator get-together just south of USMC event that discussed the future of non-conventional warfare. One aspect involves Special Operations Forces (SOF) military forces that are the vanguard in bringing the fight to the enemy. They do it anyway they can and as long as their methods are adaptable and it works –SOF ingenuity at its best. SOF leadership is well known and respected for their achievements in combat. To get some idea of how they are so successful, it will help to get a closer look at their attributes. While each U.S. and foreign SOF service will have its own list of characteristics, the U.S. Army list will be used because it largely encompasses them all.

He did not propose any  drastic changes in tactics nor invent a new method of waging  warfare, instead he excelled at the tactical handling of the  armies of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth  centuries. Napoleon established himself as a great leader of  men during the revolutionary period with the siege of Toulon  and his triumphs in Italy in 1796. These talents were  refined and reached their height during the battles of Ulm,  Austerlitz and Jena in the period of 1805-1806. Towards the  end of the Empire the weaknesses of Napoleon as a military  commander became more evident. His insistence on the micro  management of the army and the awarding of Marshal batons to  those who excelled under his leadership, but who possessed  no great talent for individual command, worked to his  determent. The strategic failures of the decisions to invade  Spain and Russia and the inability to keep the other major  European powers divided proved disastrous. The increasing  size and static nature of armies and the increasingly  murderous nature of warfare during the latter part of the  Empire revealed Napoleon's in ability to adapt to the  changing shape of war. It is in the light of his triumphs  and later failures that Napoleon's traditional reputation as  a great military leader must be judged.

As the soldiers tried to adapt, they discovered that the weapons they had been issued were sometimes not the best suited to this new and hellish environment. Many times adaptations were made to obsolete weapons of types ranging from Medieval times to the Napoleonic wars.","start_char":0,"end_char":1010}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_16_2022717024#2_2245708038","score":11.616,"doc":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army_during_World_War_II","title":"Australian Army during World War II - Wikipedia","headings":"Australian Army during World War II\nAustralian Army during World War II\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nContents\nBackground\nOrganisation\nOrigin of the Second Australian Imperial Force\nForces in Australia and the Pacific\nWomen's services\nCampaigns\nNorth Africa\nGreece, Crete, Syria and Lebanon\nEl Alamein\nMalaya and Singapore\nNetherlands East Indies and Rabaul\nDefence of Australia\nPapuan campaign\nNew Guinea offensives\nAdvance to the Philippines\nMopping up in New Guinea and the Solomons\nBorneo campaign\nPost-war years\nLeadership\nEquipment\nTraining and doctrine\nPrisoners of war\nDemobilisation\nCasualties\nNotes\nFootnotes\nCitations\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n","segment":"Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 was passed, but few did so. The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry. At the end of 1943 the Army's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades, although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945. The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943. In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific. The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941. These units were not suitable for jungle warfare, however, and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944. Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles.","start_char":2204,"end_char":3766}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_43_1478560764#4_3122688865","score":11.6143,"doc":{"url":"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/leadership-concepts","title":"Understanding Leadership Concepts in the Workplace | Indeed.com","headings":"Understanding Leadership Concepts in the Workplace\nUnderstanding Leadership Concepts in the Workplace\nWhat are leadership concepts?\nDifferences between leadership concepts and leadership theories\nLeadership concepts\nLeadership theories\nTypes of leadership concepts\nHonesty and integrity\nAbility to resolve conflict\nTwo-way communication\nAdaptability\nSelf-awareness\nEmpathy\nVision\nDiplomacy\nExamples of leadership concepts\n\"Be, know do\" leadership concept\nTwo components concept\n","segment":"There are several main types of leadership theories: trait, behavioral, management, relationship and situational theories.

Nature knows two fundamentally different ways of adaptation, which determine the further existence of the living organism the one is by increased fertility, accompanied by a relatively small degree of defensive power and individual conservation; the other is by individual equipment of manifold means of self-protection, coupled with a relatively insignificant fertility. This biological contrast seems not merely to be the analogue, but also the general foundation of our two psychological modes of adaptation, At this point a mere general indication must suffice; on the one hand, I need only point to the peculiarity of the extravert, which constantly urges him to spend and propagate himself in every way, and, on the other, to the tendency of the introvert to defend himself against external claims, to conserve himself from any expenditure of energy directly related to the object, thus consolidating for himself the most secure and impregnable position. Blake's intuition did not err when he described the two forms as the \"prolific\" and the \"devouring\" [ 1] As is [p. 415] shown by the general biological example, both forms are current and successful after their kind ; this is equally true of the typical attitudes. What the one brings about by a multiplicity of relations, the other gains by monopoly. The fact that often in their earliest years children display an unmistakable typical attitude forces us to assume that it cannot possibly be the struggle for existence, as it is generally understood, which constitutes the compelling factor in favour of a definite attitude.

Wisdom is linked not to reason but to an acceptance of how mysterious our actions can be, even to ourselves. General Kutuzov emerges as a great leader not because he develops a logical plan and then demands that everyone follow it, but rather because he is willing to adapt to the flow of events and think on his feet. He revises his plan as each stage turns out to be vastly different from what was expected. Similarly irrational actions include Nicholas’s sudden decision to wed Mary after previously resolving to go back to Sonya, and Natasha’s surprising marriage to Pierre. Yet almost all the irrational actions we see in the novel turn out successfully, in accordance with instincts in human life that, for Tolstoy, lie far deeper than our reasoning minds.

Through genuine engagement and transparent (yet accountable) decision-making processes, you can guide and drive the changes critical to your organization’s success.

A sniper is a expert military gunman who shoots over long distances from a hidden place.

Addressing these expectations usually takes the form of strategic decisions and actions. For a strategy to succeed, the leader must be able to adjust it as conditions require. But leaders cannot learn enough, fast enough, and do enough on their own to effectively adapt the strategy and then define, shape and execute the organizational response. If leaders are to win they must rely on the prepared minds of employees throughout the organization to understand the strategic intent and then both carry out the current strategy and adapt it in real time. The challenge is not only producing a winning strategy at a point in time but getting employees smart enough and motivated enough to execute the strategy and change it as conditions change.

The business environment is too complex. Although the CEO and the senior management team may have a good understanding of the business and the business environment, they will have their blind spots. They may be unaware of rising new competitors or emerging disruptive technologies, and even when they are aware, they may not appreciate their relevance or the threat that they pose.

You’re a person trying to make things better in the healthcare industry. You’re working hard to improve care, reduce costs, and improve patient satisfaction— the goals of the Triple Aim. It is hard work, though, since hearts and minds have to change, new realities need to be faced, and there is urgency to make progress. You can’t make people do this work but must help them take up the work themselves, hold their attention on it, and when the inevitable resistance arises, face it with compassion and curiosity, and try again to make progress. This is what exercising adaptive leadership means: mobilizing others to make progress addressing the gap between the way things currently are and the desired state you are striving toward. Applying these ideas can enhance your ability to effectively work with others by seeing human behavior differently and making sense of the behaviors triggered by rapid, high-volume change. Through genuine engagement and transparent (yet accountable) decision-making processes, you can guide and drive the changes critical to your organization’s success. In this tumultuous era of new reimbursement and care models—where there are many uncertainties and the changes are numerous and complex—adaptive leadership is a way of seeing the human condition and understanding what is needed to work with others.","start_char":660,"end_char":2291}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_56_1018708314#15_2085838902","score":11.2945,"doc":{"url":"https://www.usna.edu/BlueAndGoldBook/life.php","title":"Life at the Academy :: The Blue and Gold Book :: USNA","headings":"Life at the Academy\nThe Blue and Gold Book\nLife at the Academy\nDefinitions\nLiving with Honor\nThe Honor Concept\nLife in the Brigade\nPlebe Summer\nAcademic Year\nSummer training\nThird Class Summer\nSecond Class Summer\nFirst Class Summer\nLeadership Responsibility\nSpiritual Opportunities\nExtracurricular Activities\nLocal and Area Attractions\nMidshipmen Pay and Benefits\nHolidays, Leave and Privileges\nAlcohol and Drugs\nSexual Assault Prevention and Response Services\nVice Admiral James B.

Leadership Responsibility\nAs you progress through the years at the Academy, leadership responsibilities grow. Each year, you and your classmates assume more important roles in running your company, your battalion and the Brigade. By the time you are a first class midshipman, you are making daily decisions affecting the morale and performance of other midshipmen. You are teaching them the fundamentals of the naval profession and helping them through difficulties. You are leading through personal example, ability, authority and techniques you learned in the classroom and through three years experience. Your leadership responsibilities also increase in summer professional training, from learning to appreciate sailors during “youngster” cruise, to gaining a basic understanding of all warfare areas and the careers behind them before junior year, and finally, developing junior officer leadership qualities during the summer as you head into your final academic year.

They also need to adapt and thrive, regardless of the turbulence they face. Adaptation conjures up images of animals that evolve reactively in a survival-of-the-fittest competition. However, top teams don’t simply react. They proactively cultivate the fitness to survive through a disciplined approach that anticipates and shapes the future. Adapt and Thrive\nWhile it may require significant effort to cultivate a high-performing and adaptive leadership team, the work delivers a strong payback. A BCG Strategy Institute study titled “The Value of Adaptive Advantage” shows that more-adaptive companies generate powerful economic and financial gains. These companies consistently outperform their industry peers during periods of volatility, and they sustain superior performance over time, whether it’s 5 years or 30 years. The results also show a strong correlation between a company’s adaptability index score and total shareholder return.

I moved to Staten Island when I was eight and graduated from Monsignor Farrell High School in the National Honors Society. During my time at Monsignor Farrell, I was engaged in several leadership activities. Among them was my participation in the State Textbook Team. This group was organized and is run by one of my role models of leadership, Sister Grazyna. This group is tasked with distributing all of the school textbooks to every student in the school and collecting them at the end of each semester. We would also meet twice weekly in the gymnasium throughout the year just in case someone needed to exchange a book or lost one. However, this job was not all that simple. Every book contains a code and that code must be the same when the book is returned. For instance, if someone were to lose a book and borrow one from someone else or simply to steal a book, we would catch it and that person would have to pay for a new book. No one got off easy and no one got exceptions. This was a complex system and could get hectic near midterms and finals with everyone rushing to bring back their textbooks to be cleared so they could finally enjoy their summer vacation (or during midterms, a reluctant return to school). For this student organized system to run effectively, we needed a guiding role model in charge, such was Sister Grazyna. However, we also needed all the cogs in the system to work together effectively and efficiently at all times. Sometimes if someone was not living up to their expectations they would have to be let go. This would be a hard thing to do at times, but it taught the students how things run in the real world and that if you do not work to succeed you will be asked to leave. This experience taught me many crucial attributes in being a leader and a team player. It taught me to always work to full potential even if no one is watching, because, eventually, someone will notice your hard work. However, i also learned that the hard work was not just about the rewards, but about the feeling of satisfaction that came from helping my fellow students even if they didn’t always appreciate it. this experience and bond with my fellow students encouraged me to move on to other community based projects, such as volunteering at Richmond University Medical Center for a summer, participating in blood drives, snow shoveling for seniors, distributing food baskets, attending MDA meetings, becoming a third degree member of the Knights of Columbus, and my latest endeavor, joining Wagner Cares.\nMike Tomao Leadership Experiences\n","segment":"however, she managed to persevere and leave behind a powerful legacy that inspires both men and women today. The media often described Carson in an inoffensive way portraying her in common 1960s stereotypical way as a cross between a teacher and stay-at-home housewife despite the fact that she was unmarried. In fact, Life magazine even made a note that although Rachel is not married, she is not a feminist—which best parallels with the common sexist attitude of the time. Moreover, both the media and chemical companies claimed that Rachel was just “hysterical” and “irrational” since women were unfortunately considered to act this way in the 1960s. Clearly, Rachel Carson is a role model of diversity in that she was a pioneer for women in the field of science since there were few women scientists during her time and their work was often widely ignored. Furthermore, Rachel Carson inspires us all in that she succeeded in overcoming all of the sexist obstacles she faced during her career and she best exhibits a sense of diversity in that she advocated for a revolutionary, unique issue that the majority of America ignored. Under the Sea Wind Significance\nUnder the Sea Wind was Rachel Carson’s first book published in 1941 and it was followed by a sequel The Sea Around Us. It is a great book about nature writing that focuses on the lives of birds and sea creatures living in the Northeast seas and it is considered one of the Penguin Nature Classics.

The contrast of types, therefore, as a, universal psychological. phenomenon, must in some way or other have its biological precursor. The relation between subject and object, considered biologically, is always a relation of adaptation, since every relation between subject and object presupposes mutually modifying effects from either side. These modifications constitute the adaptation. The typical attitudes to the object, therefore, are adaptation processes. Nature knows two fundamentally different ways of adaptation, which determine the further existence of the living organism the one is by increased fertility, accompanied by a relatively small degree of defensive power and individual conservation; the other is by individual equipment of manifold means of self-protection, coupled with a relatively insignificant fertility. This biological contrast seems not merely to be the analogue, but also the general foundation of our two psychological modes of adaptation, At this point a mere general indication must suffice; on the one hand, I need only point to the peculiarity of the extravert, which constantly urges him to spend and propagate himself in every way, and, on the other, to the tendency of the introvert to defend himself against external claims, to conserve himself from any expenditure of energy directly related to the object, thus consolidating for himself the most secure and impregnable position.","start_char":3792,"end_char":5460}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_16_1540579679#11_1742636626","score":11.2058,"doc":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_warfare","title":"Aerial warfare - Wikipedia","headings":"Aerial warfare\nAerial warfare\nContents\nHistory\nAerial reconnaissance\nAir combat manoeuvring\nAirborne forces\nAirstrike\nStrategic bombing\nAnti-aircraft warfare\nMissiles\nUAVs\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n","segment":"NATO refers to airborne air defence as counter-air and naval air defence as anti-aircraft warfare.

In this article, we discuss the definition of situational leadership, how leaders can implement situational leadership and the advantages and disadvantages of this style of leadership. What is situational leadership? Situational leadership is a leadership style in which a leader adapts their style of leading to suit the current work environment and/or needs of a team. This style of leadership is not dependent on the skills of a leader; rather it is based on a leader's ability to adjust to the requirements of a team or organization in order to be a better and more effective leader. This leadership style may also be referred to as \"Situational Leadership Theory\" or the \"Situational Leadership Model\" and was originated by Ken Blanchard and Paul Hersey during the development of the book, Management of Organizational Behavior.","start_char":0,"end_char":1304}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_36_509858634#11_1003954033","score":11.1858,"doc":{"url":"https://www.ckju.net/en/dossier/team-effectiveness-and-team-performance-what-it-and-how-improve-it","title":"Team effectiveness and team performance: What it is and how to improve it | CQ Net - Management skills for everyone","headings":"Team effectiveness and team performance: What it is and how to improve it\nTeam effectiveness and team performance: What it is and how to improve it\nExecutive summary\nContents\nWhat is team effectiveness and how is it related to team performance?\nTeam effectiveness is also measured by outputs, linking it to team performance\nWhat makes a team effective in practice?\nTeam development interventions (TDIs) can significantly improve team effectiveness and performance\nTeam training\nLeadership training\nTeam building\nTeam debriefing\nSimulation training\nCrew Resource Management (CRM)-training\nTeam-based intervention training\nWhat are best practices in implementing team-development interventions?\nBefore implementing interventions, gather information on context and needs\nTeams benefit from leaders who empower team-members\nConstant evaluation and adaptation is key to ensuring desired outcomes\nEach team-member has a competency that should be harnessed\nTeams are psychologically safe spaces that encourage expression\nFacilitators can help guide goal-setting and evaluation\nConclusion\nCritical appraisal of team effectiveness and team performance: Solidity rating 4\nKey take-aways\nReferences and further reading\nAbout the Author\n","segment":"Teams benefit from leaders who empower team-members\nLeadership training needs to focus on equipping team leaders with interpersonal and intrapersonal skills to enable them to increase teamwork effectiveness.

The invention of machine guns, grenades, tanks, and aircraft helped convince leadership to redefine the role of the infantry squad. During WWI, a regiment's companies and platoons carried the same weapons to achieve enough massed firepower to overwhelm the enemy. The only deviation in doctrine was in the machine gun battalions equipped with 16 Browning M1917 heavy machine guns.

While it is true that charismatic leaders may sometimes achieve great results, the search for charismatic leaders under all circumstances may be irrational. Leader-Member Exchange Theory\nLeader-member exchange (LMX) theory proposes that the type of relationship leaders have with their followers (members of the organization) is the key to understanding how leaders influence employees. Leaders form different types of relationships with their employees. In high-quality LMX relationships, the leader forms a trust-based relationship with the member. The leader and member like each other, help each other when needed, and respect one another. In these relationships, the leader and the member are both ready to go above and beyond their job descriptions to promote the other’s ability to succeed. In contrast, in low-quality LMX relationships, the leader and the member have lower levels of trust, liking, and respect toward each other. These relationships do not have to involve actively disliking each other, but the leader and member do not go beyond their formal job descriptions in their exchanges. In other words, the member does his or her job, the leader provides rewards and punishments, and the relationship does not involve high levels of loyalty or obligation toward each other (Dansereau, et.","start_char":7317,"end_char":8852}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_42_456714061#16_875352824","score":11.1099,"doc":{"url":"https://www.healthcatalyst.com/why-adaptive-leadership-is-critical-skill-healthcare-leaders","title":"Why Adaptive Leadership Is a Critical Skill for Healthcare Leaders","headings":"5 Principles of Adaptive Leadership and Why It’s a Critical Skill for Healthcare Leaders\n5 Principles of Adaptive Leadership and Why It’s a Critical Skill for Healthcare Leaders\nWhy Adaptive Leadership for Healthcare Leaders?\n5 Principles of Adaptive Leadership\nThere are two types of challenges: technical and adaptive.\nPeople need a certain amount of tension to do their best work, but the amount of tension needs to be productive.\nThere is a difference between the role of authority and the exercise of leadership.\nWork avoidance (resistance) means that people are outside the productive range of tension.\nExamples of work avoidance\nReflect in action by spending time on the balcony and the dance floor.\nAn Effective Leadership Style to Achieve the Triple Aim\nKey Takeaways:\n","segment":"helping the other person see what’s in it for them; earning their trust; speaking to and understanding their perception of cost (such as their time and energy); and acknowledging their perception of the risk of following you (e.g., worrying about their status with their peers or fear of what you will ask next). Exercising leadership to do adaptive work means disappointing people’s expectations that things will stay the same at a rate they can tolerate without them ignoring you, trying to silence you, or resist you in infinitely creative ways. Leading in this way also means trying things, really seeing what happens as a result, and then trying again. Work avoidance (resistance) means that people are outside the productive range of tension. When the work at hand is adaptive change, avoidance can show up if people are overwhelmed with (above the productive range) or disengaged from work (below the productive range).

As the soldiers tried to adapt, they discovered that the weapons they had been issued were sometimes not the best suited to this new and hellish environment.

Although their military planners weren't envisioning a stagnant entrenched front stretching hundreds of miles, the Germans did anticipate laying siege to French fortresses, and grenades would be very useful in this regard.

The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units. The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units, and these began to be raised in 1941. These units were not suitable for jungle warfare, however, and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944. Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles. This organisation proved only moderately successful, and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944–45 campaigns. The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947. A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war, a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population. Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas, with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas.

Leaders who can help employees navigate challenging times and learn to address recurring problems can make a huge impact during that process. That’s why adaptive leadership is so important. Adaptive leadership is a management framework designed to help organizations not just navigate change and uncertainty, but to embrace both. This leads companies to successfully adapt, while staying true to their values and strengths. Adaptive Leadership Theory\nResearch by leadership experts, professors and authors Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky formed the basis for the theory. They suggested that business environments are everchanging and must be navigated appropriately. Applying adaptive leadership theory, professionals anticipate and identify the root causes for challenges and find ways to sustainably overcome them. This requires leaders to be more than just figureheads handing down direction. Instead, they must be open to feedback, ready for inevitable change and prepared to shift course when necessary.","start_char":0,"end_char":2526}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_08_394137595#0_689634020","score":11.0433,"doc":{"url":"http://www.ndia.org/events/2017/4/24/7260","title":"2017 Joint Undersea Warfare Technology Spring Conference","headings":"2017 Joint Undersea Warfare Technology Spring Conference\n2017 Joint Undersea Warfare Technology Spring Conference\nDescription\nThis conference is classified Secret U.S. Only.

Similarly, paranoia from lack of sleep often goes away when the affected individual catches some much needed shut-eye.

In this case, the definition of the problem is much less clear, and the perspectives on the “issue” at hand differ among stakeholders. Viable solutions and implementation pathways are unclear and defining a pathway for the solution requires learning by all. This “all” means that the primary locus of responsibility is not a single entity or person. These types of challenges require a different type of leadership and often require leadership at many levels. Adaptive Strategies\nRon Heifetz identifies six broad strategies for addressing adaptive challenges. 1\nGetting on the balcony - Stepping out of the fray to see the key patterns and the bigger picture. Leaders also need to recognize the patterns of work avoidance and the potential for conflict. Identifying the adaptive challenge - Putting the unspoken issues out on the table.","start_char":1843,"end_char":3019}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_22_1286532896#2_2819263428","score":10.9795,"doc":{"url":"https://itspsychology.com/gerascophobia/","title":"Gerascophobia: Symptoms, Causes and Treatments","headings":"Gerascophobia: Symptoms, Causes and Treatments\nGerascophobia: Symptoms, Causes and Treatments\nGerascophobia\nCharacteristics of gerascophobia\nsymptom\nPhysical alterations\nCognitive disorders\nBehavioral alterations\nWhat causes the symptoms of gerascophobia?\nIrrational\nUncontrollable\nExcessive\nIt leads to the avoidance of the feared stimulus\nPersists over time\nDisadaptive\nCauses\nClassical conditioning\nVicar conditioning / information\nGenetic factors\nCognitive factors\nTreatment\n","segment":"Characteristics of gerascophobia\nGerascophobia is one of the most particular types of specific phobias that exist today.

Aging is a fact that all people experience at some point in their life. Which entails a series of circumstances such as deterioration of physical capacity, loss of functionality, change of lifestyle, etc. This moment of life can affect each person differently. There are those who adapt to perfection and there are those who present a series of alterations related to the lack of adaptation to old age.

In these and other examples, she explained how adaptability increased her ability to successfully navigate unpleasant workplace events and interact more effectively with disruptive coworkers. She added that truly being adaptable required her to stay focused on key objectives in the face of unpredictable and sometimes highly volatile situations. She also echoed what other leaders shared about adaptability; that it is a vital component of both planned and improvisational leadership behaviors. For example, another participant noted the importance of being adaptable when she developed a plan to address a gap in employee development after assuming a C-level position, “…there was no talent program in place…so I worked with my counterpart in HR and we put something together that the team responded very favorably to. ” Adaptability in the form of improvisational leadership behaviors was also described frequently. One leader shared how adaptability played a key role in resolving a significant crisis that threatened project success at a critical moment; “ we had a run-in and she had a breakdown…I was able to work through that….and get her back on track…we ended up getting great results. ”\nSimilarly, adaptability can be important in letting go of past accomplishments in order to address the challenges that come with new roles, or shifts in leadership identity.","start_char":2748,"end_char":4324}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_21_590917850#0_1250425836","score":10.9742,"doc":{"url":"https://healthfully.com/types-questions-ask-during-cbt-8159526.html","title":"Types of Questions to Ask During CBT | Healthfully","headings":"Types of Questions to Ask During CBT\nTypes of Questions to Ask During CBT\nThought Questions\nFeelings Questions\nScale or Degree Questions\nChanging Questions\n","segment":"Types of Questions to Ask During CBT | Healthfully\nTypes of Questions to Ask During CBT\nCognitive behavior therapy, or CBT, is a group of therapeutic approaches that many mental health practitioners use. It is based on the theory that our behaviors result from thought processes, and to change our feelings and behavior, we must first change our thinking patterns. According to the National Association of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists, CBT therapists use strategies and questions to help clients recognize irrational thinking to improve mood and change problem behavior 1. Thought Questions\nCBT is based on thoughts and thought processes and how they influence behavior. CBT therapists often ask clients, \"What do you think?\" or \"What were you thinking when this happened?\" While clients sometimes find these questions frustrating, this line of questioning helps discover irrational thinking patterns. Once irrational thinking is identified, the client and therapist can find ways to make thinking more rational. CBT is based on thoughts and thought processes and how they influence behavior.

The Black Panther Party, formed in 1966, initially devoted itself to monitoring police activity and challenging police brutality in Oakland, California — not far from where this year’s Super Bowl was held — via armed citizens’ patrols. The organization later branched out into community social programs, providing free food to children and community health clinics. Nonetheless, the group was also targeted by law enforcement officials, with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover calling them “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.” Beyonce has remained silent in the face of the criticism.

Frances Senigram\nYou may think you love Beyonce, but do you love her enough to write a whole dissertation on her? Well, Molly Inglis from the University of Warwick just did. The dissertation focuses not only on Queen Bey herself, but also on the wave of feminism she has created, called “ Beyonce Feminism ,” and how the artist is paving her own way in the feminist world. via @giphy\nThe dissertation that Molly wrote is important because it makes feminism much more relatable, specifically to a younger generation. Many young adults are unclear about what exactly it means to be a feminist. Girls can now look at “Beyonce Feminism,” and see that being a feminist means being a powerful, independent woman who supports others. Her celebrity status brings a fresh face to the feminist movement. There is a stigma around feminism that it is for uptight, hippie females who hate men. But with Beyonce spearheading the movement, women can see that it is for everyone.","start_char":0,"end_char":1163}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_04_1287941600#14_2634838550","score":11.1795,"doc":{"url":"http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/singers/beyonce-net-worth/","title":"Beyonce Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth","headings":"Beyonce Net Worth\nBeyonce Net Worth\nHow much is Beyonce Worth?\nBeyonce Net Worth:\nBeyoncé Knowles\nBeyonce Earnings\nDid we make a mistake?\n","segment":"Other Fun Facts: When Jay turned 41, Beyonce gifted him a $2 million Bugatti Veyron Grand.

Think back to when Kim Kardashian and, more locally, Frankie Sandford from The Saturdays, were carrying their babies, and all the online abuse they faced for their expanding bodies.

Whenever I despair of the way women are treated, and treat each other, and wonder how it can ever get better for us, and for future generations of girls, a few names usually pop into my head that console me. What a shame that – at the moment – Beyonce’s will no longer be one of them. What a pity that we can’t even admire her morals… yes, she became vegan for a while but as she was photographed going into vegetarian restaurants wearing head to toe leather and fur, she ­obviously only did it for shallow reasons.

A discussion about Beyonce's decision to form The Suga Mamas would not be complete without revisiting the age-old question: Is Beyonce really a feminist? Even though the singer has gone on the record of referring to herself as a modern-day feminist, many critics have begged to differ, claiming that songs like \"Single Ladies\" and \"Bow Down\" are damaging to women, as well as her sometimes questionable photo shoots and overall public image. Nonetheless, the folks over at Blogher.com wrote the following about Bey and feminism, in regards to her all-female band: \"This act, I think is absolutely feminist, to include these amazing women, because as I have stated before, if you don't make note of women, to include them, they won't be included, and they will become invisible to the point that we think it is \"strange\" to see so many of them in a band.\" So, what do you think?

Critics will tend to bash them while society will judge them harshly for what they feel is a lack of pride in their identity. Such has been the situation since the alleged Beyonce skin bleaching. To digress from the normal criticism, there is a positive angle from which to look at skin bleaching. When skin bleaching products are used for cosmetic treatments, they help to improve how the user’s skin looks as well as fight the signs of previous skin conditions. With correct use, skin lightening products help to bring out the best out of a person. With time, the skin gets sun damaged, hormones wreck havoc on breakouts and pregnancy brings about melasma.","start_char":2421,"end_char":3486}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_02_286806624#4_521791488","score":10.5674,"doc":{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/17/face-off-jay-z-beyonce-v-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-4234028/","title":"Face Off: Jay Z & Beyonce v Kim Kardashian and Kanye West | Metro News","headings":"Face Off: Jay Z & Beyonce v Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\nFace Off: Jay Z & Beyonce v Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\nComment\nBeyonce and Jay Z Vs Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (Picture: File)\nTalent\nBeyonce can boast impressive record sales (Picture: AP)\nLover’s support\nBeyoncé - Drunk in Love (Explicit) ft.

While some researchers seem to focus on cultural considerations among individuals with eating disorders, it is difficult to identify the relative level of socio-cultural considerations in the development of these disorders. It is imperative to consider eating disorders from a holistic perspective and recognize that the interaction between genetic factors, social and cultural factors such as media images determine their relative contributions. Many clinicians and researchers focus more on the social and cultural aspects in that the beauty ideals of Western culture seem to overemphasize thinness among women, resulting in a higher level of risk in the development of an eating disorder. Although mainstream media seems to focus on the thinness ideal of media images possibly underlying anorexia nervosa, many people are exposed to these same images and do not develop eating disorders. Feeding and Eating Disorders Treatment: Because of the multifactorial social and psychological etiology of feeding and eating disorders which makes these disorders so difficult to treat, treatment also needs to be multi-dimensional in most cases. The specific treatment will be according to the specific presentation and individual, social, psychological, and interpersonal factors involved, with special attention to behavioral, physical and emotional health. Also, of consideration will be the necessary level of care, which can range from inpatient to residential to outpatient treatment.

A number of risk factors have been implicated in the development of psychological disorders, but their relative contributions to mental illness are specific to different disorders and individual patients, and a precise cause can rarely be identified on an individual basis. ( 1) Below is a sampling of some of the variables identified as risk factors in the development of psychological disorders. Please note that the following list is not an exhaustive list of all factors that may contribute to mental illness, and should not be used as a diagnostic tool.

Gene-environment interactions describe the phenomenon by which certain gene variants modulate the effects of environmental factors. However, environmental factors often cause epigenetic changes –chemical modifications that affect how genes are expressed – making it difficult to distinguish environmental from genetic effects. Increased interest in epigenetics has prompted modern psychiatric research to focus on biochemical mechanisms by which environmental factors may influence genetic expression and the onset of psychological disorders.

The biopsychosocial model of health and illness is a framework developed by George L. Engel that states that interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors determine the cause, manifestation, and outcome of wellness and disease. Historically, popular theories like the nature versus nurture debate posited that any one of these factors was sufficient to change the course of development. The biopsychosocial model argues that any one factor is not sufficient; it is the interplay between people’s genetic makeup (biology), mental health and behavior (psychology), and social and cultural context that determine the course of their health-related outcomes. Biopsychosocial model of health and illness\nThis diagram shows how biological, psychological, and sociological factors overlap to determine overall health. Biological Influences on Health\nBiological influences on health include an individual’s genetic makeup and history of physical trauma or infection. Many disorders have an inherited genetic vulnerability.

For instance, losing one's job or ending a romantic relationship may place one at risk of stress and illness. Such life events may predispose an individual to developing depression, which may, in turn, contribute to physical health problems. The impact of social factors is widely recognized in mental disorders like anorexia nervosa (a disorder characterized by excessive and purposeful weight loss despite evidence of low body weight). The fashion industry and the media promote an unhealthy standard of beauty that emphasizes thinness over health. This exerts social pressure to attain this \"ideal\" body image despite the obvious health risks. Cultural Factors\nAlso included in the social domain are cultural factors. For instance, differences in the circumstances, expectations, and belief systems of different cultural groups contribute to different prevalence rates and symptom expression of disorders.

The causes of mental disorders are very complex and vary depending on the particular disorder and the individual. Although the causes of most mental disorders are not fully understood, researchers have identified a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that can contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders. Most mental disorders result in a combination of several different factors rather than just a single factor.

Cultural Factors\nAlso included in the social domain are cultural factors. For instance, differences in the circumstances, expectations, and belief systems of different cultural groups contribute to different prevalence rates and symptom expression of disorders. For example, anorexia is less common in non-western cultures because they put less emphasis on thinness in women. Culture can vary across a small geographic range, such as from lower-income to higher-income areas, and rates of disease and illness differ across these communities accordingly. Culture can even change biology, as research on epigenetics is beginning to show. Specifically, research on epigenetics suggests that the environment can actually alter an individual's genetic makeup. For instance, research shows that individuals exposed to over-crowding and poverty are more at risk for developing depression with actual genetic mutations forming over only a single generation. Application of the Biopsychosocial Model\nThe biopsychosocial model states that the workings of the body, mind, and environment all affect each other. According to this model, none of these factors in isolation is sufficient to lead definitively to health or illness—it is the deep interrelation of all three components that leads to a given outcome.","start_char":4737,"end_char":6132}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_1197443140#2_2468987136","score":25.7547,"doc":{"url":"https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-psychology/chapter/introduction-to-the-field-of-psychology/","title":"Introduction to the Field of Psychology | Boundless Psychology","headings":"Introduction to the Field of Psychology\nIntroduction to the Field of Psychology\nDefining Psychology\nLearning Objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nKey Terms\nClinical vs. Non-Clinical Psychology\nEarly Roots of Psychology\nLearning Objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nKey Terms\nEarly Philosophy\n17th Century\nPsychology as an Independent Discipline\nWilhelm Wundt\nWilhelm Wundt\nStructuralism\nFunctionalism\nCurrent Issues and Debates in Psychology\nLearning Objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nKey Terms\nDefining “Normal” and “Healthy”\nNature vs. Nurture Debate\nChanges to (and Controversies within) the DSM-5\nAutism Spectrum Disorder\nGender Dysphoria\nDepressive Disorders\nBorderline Personality Disorder\nElectroconvulsive Therapy\n","segment":"sociocultural: Of or relating to both society and culture.

The overarching goal of psychology is to understand the behavior, mental functions, and emotional processes of human beings. This field ultimately aims to benefit society, partly through its focus on better understanding of mental health and mental illness. Most psychologists can be classified as social, behavioral, or cognitive scientists.

Moffitt's original statement of the theory is one of the more important articles in criminology with 2,792 citations. She proposes that there are two main types of antisocial offenders in society. Adolescent Limited offenders exhibit antisocial behavior only during adolescence. Life-Course-Persistent offenders begin to behave antisocially early in childhood and continue this behavior into adulthood. This theory is used with respect to antisocial behavior instead of crime due to the differing definitions of 'crime' among cultures. Due to similar characteristics and trajectories, this theory can be applied to both females and males.

The bio-psycho-social model of illness is a way of understanding disorder that assumes that disorder is caused by biological, psychological, and social factors ( Figure 12.1 “The Bio-Psycho-Social Model” ). The biological component of the bio-psycho-social model refers to the influences on disorder that come from the functioning of the individual’s body. Particularly important are genetic characteristics that make some people more vulnerable to a disorder than others and the influence of neurotransmitters. The psychological component of the bio-psycho-social model refers to the influences that come from the individual, such as patterns of negative thinking and stress responses. The social component of the bio-psycho-social model refers to the influences on disorder due to social and cultural factors such as socioeconomic status, homelessness, abuse, and discrimination. Figure 12.1 The Bio-Psycho-Social Model\nThe bio-psycho-social model of disorder proposes that disorders are caused by biological, psychological, and social-cultural factors. To consider one example, the psychological disorder of schizophrenia has a biological cause because it is known that there are patterns of genes that make a person vulnerable to the disorder (Gejman, Sanders, & Duan, 2010). But whether or not the person with a biological vulnerability experiences the disorder depends in large part on psychological factors such as how the individual responds to the stress he experiences, as well as social factors such as whether or not he is exposed to stressful environments in adolescence and whether or not he has support from people who care about him (Sawa & Snyder, 2002; Walker, Kestler, Bollini, & Hochman, 2004).","start_char":4254,"end_char":6063}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_26_1005394679#10_1986740971","score":25.6435,"doc":{"url":"https://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/cultural-psychology/culture-and-mental-health/","title":"Culture and Mental Health (CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY) iResearchNet","headings":"Culture and Mental Health\nCulture and Mental Health\nThe Growing Popularity of Culture and Mental Health\nCritical Concepts and Issues\nEthnocentrism\nCultural Construction of Reality\nKey Questions in the Study of Culture and Psychopathology\nSome Critical Issues and Research Findings\nBiology and Culture in Psychopathology\nConcepts of Illness and Disease\nEquivalence in Clinical Assessment\nEpidemiology\nResearch Strategies for Studying Culture and Symptomatology Relationships\nEthnocultural Parameters of Psychopathology\nDepressive Disorders\nSchizophrenia\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nCultures as Causative of Psychiatric Disorders\n1.

Although many behaviors could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology typically deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, functionally, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \"abnormal\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind-body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal. The science of abnormal psychology studies two types of behaviors: adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.","start_char":0,"end_char":2061}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_1197251262#7_2468676067","score":25.5189,"doc":{"url":"https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-psychology/chapter/introduction-to-human-development/","title":"Introduction to Human Development | Boundless Psychology","headings":"Introduction to Human Development\nIntroduction to Human Development\nNature vs. Nurture\nLearning Objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nKey Terms\nDevelopmental Psychology\nNature Versus Nurture\nInteraction of Genes and the Environment\nDiathesis-Stress Model\nMethods for Researching Human Development\nLearning Objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nKey Terms\nResearch Methods\nExperimental Research\nCorrelational Research\nCase Study\nResearch Designs\nLongitudinal Design\nCross-Sectional Design\nCross-Sequential Design\nMicrogenetic Design\n","segment":"For example, situations of extreme stress can cause problems like depression.

Such variation may be innate, learned, or both. Modern research attempts to distinguish between these causes and to analyze any ethical concerns raised. Since behavior is a result of interactions between nature and nurture, researchers are interested in investigating how biology and environment interact to produce such differences, although this is often not possible.

Individuals with a genetic vulnerability may be more likely to display negative thinking that puts them at risk for depression; alternatively, psychological factors may exacerbate a biological predisposition by putting a genetically vulnerable person at risk for other risk behaviors. For example, depression on its own may not cause liver problems, but a person with depression may be more likely to abuse alcohol, and, therefore, develop liver damage. Increased risk-taking leads to an increased likelihood of disease. Social Influences on Health\nSocial factors include socioeconomic status, culture, technology, and religion. For instance, losing one's job or ending a romantic relationship may place one at risk of stress and illness. Such life events may predispose an individual to developing depression, which may, in turn, contribute to physical health problems. The impact of social factors is widely recognized in mental disorders like anorexia nervosa (a disorder characterized by excessive and purposeful weight loss despite evidence of low body weight).

This suggests that no single factor – biological, social, or psychological – is solely responsible for the condition, but a complex and highly interrelated web of all three factors that must be considered. It seems that genetics play some role in schizoid personality disorder, and all the recognized personality disorders, as research suggests an increased risk among people whose parents or close relatives also have schizoid personality disorder. A hypothesis referenced by Jeffrey Seinfeld in his book, The Empty Core: An Object Relations Approach to Psychotherapy of the Schizoid Personality suggests the disorder and others, including addiction, may be significantly sourced in early childhood through a lack of love and empathy, the need for which is seen as analogous to a newborn’s physiological need for oxygen. This causes the “empty core” of the book’s title, and the person with a personality disorder may try to fill that emptiness with drugs, alcohol, or food, or they may repress and dissociate the “needy self” by denying themselves social interaction (in the case of schizoid personality disorder) or food ( in the case of bulimia ). Addiction and Schizoid Personality Disorder\nMedical and psychiatric literature does not call out addiction or substance abuse as arising specifically out of schizoid personality disorder.

Most mental disorders result in a combination of several different factors rather than just a single factor.

Correlations of mental disorders with drug use include almost all psychoactive substances, e.g., cannabis, alcohol, and caffeine . Mental illnesses have risk factors, for instance including unequal parental treatment, adverse life events and drug use in depression, migration and discrimination, childhood trauma, loss or separation in families, and cannabis use in schizophrenia and psychosis, and parenting factors, child abuse, family history (e.g. of anxiety), and temperament and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) in anxiety. Many psychiatric disorders include problems with impulse and other emotional control . In February 2013, a study found genetic links between five major psychiatric disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.","start_char":514,"end_char":2843}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_53_518364018#2_1032160570","score":25.1635,"doc":{"url":"https://www.studystack.com/flashcard-667579","title":"Free Psychology Flashcards about Psychology Prologue!","headings":"Psychology Prologue!\nQuestion\nQuestion\nPsychology Prologue!\nAP Psych helpful vocab cards\n","segment":"AP Psych helpful vocab cards\nQuestion\nAnswer\nThe view that knowledge comes from experience via the senses, and science flourishes through observation and experience.

In non-western countries, gender is not always conceived as binary, or strictly linked to biological sex. As a result, in some cultures there are third, fourth, fifth or \"some\" genders. The characteristics that generally define gender are referred to as masculine or feminine. The formation of gender is controversial in many scientific fields, including psychology. Specifically, researchers and theorists take different perspectives on how much of gender is due to biological, neurochemical, and evolutionary factors (nature), or is the result of culture and socialization (nurture). This is known as the nature versus nurture debate. The subfields of psychology note specific differences in the traits of each gender, based on their perspective of the issue on the nature versus nurture debate.

Gene-environment interactions describe the phenomenon by which certain gene variants modulate the effects of environmental factors. However, environmental factors often cause epigenetic changes –chemical modifications that affect how genes are expressed – making it difficult to distinguish environmental from genetic effects. Increased interest in epigenetics has prompted modern psychiatric research to focus on biochemical mechanisms by which environmental factors may influence genetic expression and the onset of psychological disorders.

The disturbances do not reflect expected or culturally approved responses to certain events.

When an electric impulse reaches neuron’s ending, the nerve ending is stimulated to release a chemical called neurotransmitter. Abnormal activity in releasing these neurotransmitters can lead to specific psychological disorders. Low activity of neurotransmitter aminobutyric acid ( GABA) leads to Anxiety disorder. Access activity of dopamine can cause schizophrenia. Low activity of serotonin leads to depression.","start_char":2376,"end_char":3164}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_34_1626378808#5_3416087703","score":24.5845,"doc":{"url":"https://www.britannica.com/science/social-psychology","title":"Social psychology | Britannica","headings":"Social psychology\nSocial psychology\nResearch methods\nSocial perception\n","segment":"Sound and video recorders and other devices record ongoing social interaction; computing equipment and other paraphernalia may be employed for specific studies. Social behaviour is understood to be the product of innate biological factors resulting from evolution and of cultural factors that have emerged in the course of history. Early writers (e.g., William McDougall, a psychologist) emphasized instinctive roots of social behaviour. Later research and writing that tended to stress learning theory emphasized the influence of environmental factors in social behaviour. In the 1960s and ’70s field studies of nonhuman primates (such as baboons) drew attention to a number of similarities to human social behaviour, while research in cultural anthropology has shown that many features of human social behaviour are the same regardless of the culture studied. It is coming to be a widely accepted view that human social behaviour seems to have a biological basis and to reflect the operation of evolution as in the case of patterns of emotional expression and other nonverbal communication, the structure of language, and aspects of group behaviour. Much research has been done on socialization (the process of learning from a culture), and learning has been found to interact with innate factors.

They explore how psychological factors interact with biological and sociocultural factors to influence individual development. Psychologists attempt to understand not only the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, but also the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. Biology, psychology, and society shape our lives: Psychology seeks to understand how psychological factors interact with sociocultural and biological factors to influence individual development. Psychology explores concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, resilience, the unconscious mind, and interpersonal relationships.

The psychological component of the biopsychosocial model seeks to find a psychological foundation for a particular symptom or array of symptoms (e.g., impulsivity, irritability, overwhelming sadness, etc.). Social and cultural factors are conceptualized as a particular set of stressful events (being laid off, for example) that may differently impact the mental health of people from different social environments and histories.

A large range of differences exists among individuals’ vulnerabilities to the development of a disorder. The diathesis, or predisposition, interacts with the individual’s subsequent stress response. Stress is a life event or series of events that disrupts a person’s psychological equilibrium and may catalyze the development of a disorder. Thus the diathesis–stress model serves to explore how biological or genetic traits (diatheses) interact with environmental influences (stressors) to produce disorders such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia. The use of the term diathesis in medicine and in the specialty of psychiatry dates back to the 1800s; however, the diathesis–stress model was not introduced and used to describe the development of psychopathology until it was applied to explaining schizophrenia in the 1960s by Paul Meehl. The diathesis–stress model is used in many fields of psychology, specifically for studying the development of psychopathology. It is useful for the purposes of understanding the interplay of nature and nurture in the susceptibility to psychological disorders throughout the lifespan.

Overall, the research literature suggests that psychological difficulties are common among patients with pain. Left undetected and untreated, these difficulties may impede a patient’s progress in treatment and lead to long-lasting symptomatology. Among those who report pain and injury, psychosocial factors may play a major role in delayed recovery. One study of psychosocial factors demonstrated an ability to accurately predict delayed recovery for patients suffering acute pain 91% of the time without using medical information. 13 Another study found that psychosocial factors play a dominant role in surgical outcome. 14 Lastly, in a World Health Organization study of 25,916 medical patients from around world, psychological factors were found to be a stronger contributor to disability than was disease severity. 15\nWhile chronic pain is generally recognized as being a biopsychosocial phenomenon, what is often overlooked is that illness, injury, psychological and social factors interact over the course of time to produce distinctly different types of biopsychosocial disorders. Effective treatment requires that the clinician not only identify the biological, psychological and social aspects of a condition, but also understand how each component interacts.

Behaviors that are adaptive are ones that are well-suited to the nature of people, their lifestyles and surroundings, and to the people that they communicate with, allowing them to understand each other. Clinical psychology is the applied field of psychology that seeks to assess, understand, and treat psychological conditions in clinical practice. The theoretical field known as 'abnormal psychology' may form a backdrop to such work, but clinical psychologists in the current field are unlikely to use the term 'abnormal' in reference to their practice. Psychopathology is a similar term to abnormal psychology but has more of an implication of an underlying pathology (disease process), and as such is a term more commonly used in the medical specialty known as psychiatry.

The short answer is that no one knows, but theories abound. The most commonly referenced hypothesis of the cause of schizoid personality disorder is the biopsychosocial model of causation. Basically, this suggests the causes are rather broad and touch many areas of a person’s life. They include biological and genetic factors, including family history of similar conditions. Social factors – including interaction in childhood with family, friends and other children – are also indicated as well as psychological factors, such as a person’s temperament, personality, and ability to deal with stress. This suggests that no single factor – biological, social, or psychological – is solely responsible for the condition, but a complex and highly interrelated web of all three factors that must be considered.

What caused dancing mania is not known, but several explanations have been proposed, including spider venom and ergot poisoning (“Dancing Mania,” 2011). Figure 15.7 Although the cause of dancing mania, depicted in this painting, was unclear, the behavior was attributed to supernatural forces. Historian John Waller (2009a, 2009b) has provided a comprehensive and convincing explanation of dancing mania that suggests the phenomenon was attributable to a combination of three factors: psychological distress, social contagion, and belief in supernatural forces. Waller argued that various disasters of the time (such as famine, plagues, and floods) produced high levels of psychological distress that could increase the likelihood of succumbing to an involuntary trance state. Waller indicated that anthropological studies and accounts of possession rituals show that people are more likely to enter a trance state if they expect it to happen, and that entranced individuals behave in a ritualistic manner, their thoughts and behavior shaped by the spiritual beliefs of their culture.

Individuals with a genetic vulnerability may be more likely to display negative thinking that puts them at risk for depression; alternatively, psychological factors may exacerbate a biological predisposition by putting a genetically vulnerable person at risk for other risk behaviors.

Discrimination, whether based on age,criminal record, disability, family status, gender identity, gender expression, generation, genetic characteristics, marital status, nationality, color, race and ethnicity, religion, sex and sex characteristics, sexual orientation, or social class, can influence the development of a psychological disorder. Other Socio-cultural factors include the e ffects of urban/rural dwelling, gender and minority status on state of mind and Generalizations about cultural practices and beliefs may fail to capture the diversity that exists within and across cultural groups, so we must be extremely careful not to stereotype individuals of any cultural group. The Biopsychosocial Model of Illness\nAlthough there are no pure psychological causes in the biopsychosocial perspective, those that reflect learning, life experiences, or exposure to certain situations may be thought of as reflecting predominantly psychological influences. These can also include difficulty coping with stress, illogical fears, susceptibility to uncontrollable emotions, and a host of other dysfunctional thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that lead individuals to meet the criteria for psychological disorder. People have tried to explain and control abnormal behavior for thousands of years. Historically, there have been three main approaches to abnormal behavior: the supernatural, biological, and psychological traditions. The bio-psycho-social model of illness is a way of understanding disorder that assumes that disorder is caused by biological, psychological, and social factors (Figure above “The Bio-Psycho-Social Model”).

Adler believed that the behavior of adults is motivated by striving for superiority, a drive for perfection. Karen Horney proposed that many adult characteristics are produced by attempts to deal with basic anxiety, a feeling of being isolated and helpless in a potentially hostile world. Horney was also a pioneer in the study of psychology of women. She suggested that outside the family, women experience harmful effects because society places a greater value on being male, an attitude that contributes to women's feeling of inferiority and lack of self‐esteem.

This essay will focus on unipolar disorder and for simplicity, will be referred to as ‘depression’. Even though social factors evidently contribute to depression, it makes more sense that such disorder should have biological basis. Hammen, 1997 proposed four different reasons to support such belief: Symptoms of depression include physical changes, depression appears to run in families, success of medication and particular kinds of illness/injury/drugs could give rise to depression. This essay will explore the similarities and differences between the biological and psychological explanations of depression, specifically looking at neurotransmitter dysfunction (biochemical factors), genetic factors (twin/adoption studies), Beck’s theory of depression (cognitive explanations), Freud’s theory (psychodynamic explanation) and life events (socio-cultural factors).","start_char":378,"end_char":1704}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_16_1468450540#10_1663446344","score":23.7556,"doc":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_psychology","title":"Abnormal psychology - Wikipedia","headings":"Abnormal psychology\nAbnormal psychology\nContents\nHistory\nHumors\nAsylums\nDeinstitutionalisation\nExplaining abnormal behaviour\nSupernatural explanations\nSupernatural traditions\nBiological explanations\nPsychological explanations\nIrrational beliefs\nSociocultural influences\nMultiple causality\nRecent concepts of abnormality\nExamples\nSchizophrenia\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\nAnti-Social Personality Disorder\nDissociative Identity Disorder\nSocial Anxiety Disorder\nGeneralized anxiety Disorder\nSpecific Phobia\nPost-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nApproaches\nClassification\nDSM-5\nSection I (DSM-5 Basics)\nSection II (Diagnostic Criteria and Codes)\nSection III (Emerging Measures and Models)\nICD-10\nICD-11\nMental, behavioral, or Neurodevelopmental disorders\nPerspectives of Abnormal psychology\nCause\nGenetics\nBiological causal factors\nSocio-cultural factors\nSystemic factors\nBiopsychosocial factors\nTherapies\nPsychoanalysis (Freud)\nBehavioral therapy (Wolpe)\nHumanistic therapy (Rogers)\nCognitive behavioural therapy (Ellis and Beck)\nPlay Therapy (Humanistic)\nFamily Systems Therapies\nFamily Management Skill development (Family systems Therapy)\nChild-parent attachment development (Family Systems therapy)\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nFurther reading\n","segment":"Recent studies have found that the prevalence of mental illness has not decreased significantly in the past 10 years, and has in fact increased in frequency regarding specific conditions such as anxiety and mood disorders. This led to a large number of the patients being released while not being fully cured of the disorder they were hospitalized for. This became known as the phenomenon of deinstitutionalization. This movement had noble goals of treating the individuals outside of the isolated mental hospital by placing them into communities and support systems. Another goal of this movement was to avoid the potential negative adaptations that can come with long term hospital confinements. Many professionals for example were concerned that patients would find permanent refuge in mental hospitals which would take them up when the demands of everyday life were too difficult. However, the patients moved to the community living have not fared well typically, as they often speak of how they feel “abandoned” by the doctors who used to treat them. It also has had the unfortunate effect of placing many of the patients in homelessness.

The urinary tract ends in one of the body’s two waste orifices, so, it sees a lot of bacteria. The problem occurs when the wrong kind of bacteria enter from the wrong end of the tract. What is a urinary tract infection? A urinary tract infection occurs when fecal bacteria enter the urethra, the tube through which urine is excreted from the bladder. Sexually transmitted bacteria can also enter the urethra and cause an infection. There are three types of urinary tract infections. The first, urethritis, is an infection localized to the urethra. When an infection spreads from the urethra to the bladder, it is known as cystitis. These two infections are the most common and easily cured, but it is possible for an infection to spread from the bladder to the kidneys.","start_char":0,"end_char":1081}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_35_1168447708#1_2716888182","score":15.9572,"doc":{"url":"https://www.cathaydrug.com/why-women-are-more-prone-to-uti-than-men/","title":"Why Women are More Prone to UTI Than Men - Cathay Drug","headings":"Why Women are More Prone to UTI Than Men\nWhy Women are More Prone to UTI Than Men\nAll the facts are in: it’s been established that women are more prone to urinary tract infections than men.\nReasons Why Women are More Prone to UTI than Men\n1.

Depending on the height, age and weight of a man, a typical male can eat up to an average of 2,500 up to 5,000 calories a day just to sustain his energy and gusto all throughout a day. Although this study is not applicable to all males, a lot of men do consume more food that normal women would. In fact, recent studies have found out that men are more prone to acquiring heart diseases because, compared to the opposite sex, they are less vigilant and watchful of what they put in their mouths. So why do men eat more than women? It could be for a lot of reasons. As we said, age is a key factor that could affect a man’s appetite. For instance, for a boy going through puberty, he is more likely to eat more than a girl because of his raging hormones and the testosterone that is building up in his body. Another reason why it is likely for men to eat more than women is the fact that men have more muscles than the opposite sex which makes them more prone to needing a lot of energy in order for them to keep their body mass from atrophying.

It also shows that women who take birth control pills are less likely to experience these injuries. Doctors believe that this has to do with the fact that birth control pills both lower estrogen levels and keep them more consistent. Muscular Imbalances\nIn addition to hormonal differences, women are also at a risk for knee injuries because of imbalances in strength between their quadriceps and hamstrings. Men tend to have a better balance of strength between their quadriceps and hamstrings. Women, on the other hand, tend to develop stronger quadriceps to compensate for their wider hips.

Thyroid symptoms in women are more frequently caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. Up to ninety percent of all cases of hypothyroidism are caused by Hashimoto’s Disease, an autoimmune disorder that is about seven times more likely to affect women than men. Why are women more prone to thyroid disorders than men? Women experience autoimmune disease at a higher rate than men due to many factors. Excessive estrogen levels can lead to autoimmune disease because high estrogen causes immune system problems.

This movement puts stress on the ACL, especially during the added force of landing a jump or turning. Biomechanics\nThe way bodies move and react can differ by gender. For example, women’s knees tend to be more flexible than men’s, leaving them more prone to hyperextend the knee and put strain on surrounding muscles, tendons, and ligaments.

As we said, age is a key factor that could affect a man’s appetite. For instance, for a boy going through puberty, he is more likely to eat more than a girl because of his raging hormones and the testosterone that is building up in his body. Another reason why it is likely for men to eat more than women is the fact that men have more muscles than the opposite sex which makes them more prone to needing a lot of energy in order for them to keep their body mass from atrophying. Another possible reason as to why men eat more than women is the fact that most men tend to have more active lifestyles than women.

For one thing, women’s tendons move around more because, to accommodate childbirth, they are more elastic and also more prone to injury. Also women’s wider hips affect the alignment of the knees in a way that leaves them more vulnerable to certain types of injuries, which translates to more arthritis down the road.

As women has to perform one of the noblest and most vital activities, that is giving birth to the future generation, nature has endowed women with more immunity against many diseases such as heart attack and certain coronary diseases. The reason for this is the difference in sex hormones. While men have more testosterone content, which tends to impair the immune system slightly, women have more estrogen content, which enhances the functioning of the immune system. Estrogen content makes sure that women have more HDL cholesterol, which is good for immunity, and less LDL cholesterol, which is not so good for immunity. In men, it is the other way around.

On a similar thread, research on the bias has also found that men scoring higher in self-reported masculinity, are more prone to sexual overperception. 4 This could mean that workplaces with greater levels of masculine culture would experience more instances of sexual overperception bias. Why it happens\nIdeas from evolutionary biology are largely accountable for the most prominent theories around why we see a sexual overperception bias. As reproductive rates have the potential to be higher in men than women, it is more “costly” for men to miss a mating opportunity than it is for women, and these differences in costs result in men being more sensitive to sexually opportunistic cues. In less academic terms: since men don’t have to go through the laborious journey of child-rearing in order to pass their DNA along, they’re naturally inclined to be more attentive to the possibility of sex as it’s less costly for them to replicate their genes than it is for women. With a greater implicit attentiveness, the prevalence of false-positives in judging sexual interest is inevitable.

They are mostly diagnosed in older adults, although it is possible for children to contract an infection. UTI’s occur in women significantly more than men - in fact, 40% of women will get a UTI in their lifetimes while only about 12% of men will get the same condition. The Affiliated Urologists team explains that the primary reason for this is because of female anatomy. A woman’s urethra is shorter than her male counterpart’s. This means that bacteria do not have to travel as far from the urethral opening outside of the body to get to the bladder or other parts of the urinary tract. Our urology experts explain that a woman’s urethra opening is located close to the anus, so it is easier for her to bring bacteria from the anus into the urethra. This is often done when wiping after urinating or passing a bowel movement, but it’s also easy to do during sexual activity. While it is possible for a man to inadvertently transfer the bacteria as well, it is less likely since a male’s urethra is further away. Women also are more prone to catching a UTI if they use a contraceptive diaphragm.","start_char":0,"end_char":1236}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_58_867254661#4_1287245455","score":13.9959,"doc":{"url":"https://www.womenfitnessmag.com/3-reasons-why-women-are-more-prone-to-knee-injuries/","title":"3 Reasons Why Women are More Prone to Knee Injuries - Women Fitness Magazine","headings":"3 Reasons Why Women are More Prone to Knee Injuries\n3 Reasons Why Women are More Prone to Knee Injuries\nHormonal Differences\nMuscular Imbalances\nMotor Differences\nHow to Prevent Knee Injuries\nSome other simple ways to prevent injury include:\nRelated Videos:\n3 Reasons Why Women are More prone to Knee Injuries\nLike this:\n","segment":"Completing a proper dynamic warm-up before exercising or training\nStarting slow when beginning a new exercise program\nWearing supportive, sport-specific shoes\nMaintaining a healthy weight to reduce the amount of stress placed on the knees\nDoing hamstring- strengthening exercises like deadlifts and legs curls\nIf you’ve already experienced a knee injury and want to prevent additional damage, you can also wear an open patella knee brace support (the kind that’s also used for meniscus tears) to keep the knee moving through a proper range of motion.

Hormonal Differences\nWomen experience knee injuries, particularly anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, at a greater rate than men. One reason for this is the fact that women have higher estrogen levels. Research has found a link between estrogen spikes at certain points during the menstrual cycle and the incidence of ACL tears. It also shows that women who take birth control pills are less likely to experience these injuries. Doctors believe that this has to do with the fact that birth control pills both lower estrogen levels and keep them more consistent. Muscular Imbalances\nIn addition to hormonal differences, women are also at a risk for knee injuries because of imbalances in strength between their quadriceps and hamstrings.","start_char":0,"end_char":1504}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_25_155410994#2_320544509","score":13.9779,"doc":{"url":"https://newyorkessays.com/essay-southern-horrors-ida-b-wells/","title":"Southern Horrors: Ida B.

There is probably a combination of factors that contribute to the higher incidence of injuries among female athletes. And we have more theories than actual answers. The most common explanation is that it’s due to basic differences between the bodies of men and women. For example, the typical female athlete, as compared with her male counterpart, has: higher estrogen levels, along with less muscle mass and more body fat\ngreater flexibility (due to looser ligaments) and less powerful muscles\na wider pelvis, which alters the alignment of the knee and ankle\na narrower space within the knee for the ACL to travel through\na greater likelihood of inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

Women experience autoimmune disease at a higher rate than men due to many factors. Excessive estrogen levels can lead to autoimmune disease because high estrogen causes immune system problems.

Women also experience higher levels of inflammation compared to men when they are under stress.

Then odds are you're a woman and you live in either North America or Western Europe. That's the conclusion of a new British study that found that women are twice as likely to suffer from anxiety as men. Moreover, people in North America and Western Europe are more prone to anxiety disorders than those from other parts of the world. In North America, nearly eight of 100 people suffer from anxiety -- the most in the world. In East Asia, it's fewer than three in 100 -- the lowest, the review authors noted. \"Anxiety is important and shouldn't be overlooked,\" said lead researcher Olivia Remes, who's with the department of public health and primary care at the University of Cambridge's Strangeways Research Laboratory. \" Sometimes people think that anxiety is just a part of their personality or that there's nothing they can do about it, but there is.\" Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive worry, fear and avoidance of potentially stressful situations, such as social gatherings.

Women’s skin tissues around the mouth contain fewer blood vessels than men's. Better circulation may help slow wrinkle development.

For one thing, women’s tendons move around more because, to accommodate childbirth, they are more elastic and also more prone to injury. Also women’s wider hips affect the alignment of the knees in a way that leaves them more vulnerable to certain types of injuries, which translates to more arthritis down the road. Hormones play a role too. Estrogen helps keep inflammation in check, which is why younger women have less arthritis than men – but when levels plummet with menopause, arthritis often arrives. Researchers are currently trying to tease out other complicated findings regarding how hormones shape arthritis risk, with apparent connections between age of puberty, childbearing and the use of hormone replacement therapy. Extra weight means more arthritis. Obesity is more common in women than men. Excess weight puts pressure on the knee joints, eroding cartilage and therefore raising arthritis risk.

New research shows women may be more likely to be the culprits of infidelity than men. It’s not that women are more likely to cheat than men per se, but biologically and genetically, we possess different features that vary our behaviors. This research is colossal because ideologically, we tend to assume men are the more likely culprits due evolutionary implications. From a “survival of the fittest perspective,” it makes slightly more sense that they would spread their seed to as many women as possible. Women, on the other hand, don’t share this evolutionary ideology, and are more so on the opposite spectrum: supposedly choosing most carefully a mate who we believe could provide and take care of us, although this obviously isn’t always the case.

In fact, some studies show that any degree of alcohol intake may have harmful effects on both men and on women. But the risk for cirrhosis is higher when there’s underlying liver disease, and with the ingestion of certain drugs — both of which women are more prone to experience.” Fatty deposits in the liver commonly happen as a result of drinking alcohol and not only by gaining weight. Drugs and alcohol affect women’s livers earlier and more rapidly than men, and at a lower dose, she says.

She wanted to change that. In 1913, she founded the first suffragist organization for black women in Chicago, the Alpha Suffrage Club. But as she worked to mobilize women, she met opposition from two groups: white women, who still did not have the right to vote in all elections, and black men, who legally had full suffrage but still faced unfair voting taxes, literacy tests, and other roadblocks. \"There were white women who were very upset that black men had the right to vote but white women didn't, and there were some black men who thought that if black women could vote, that would dilute their power that would make them weaker,\" says Annie Logue, president of the League of Women Voters Chicago.","start_char":2076,"end_char":3492}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_03_227635222#2_419897867","score":13.724,"doc":{"url":"http://theconversation.com/women-are-far-more-anxious-than-men-heres-the-science-60458","title":"Women are far more anxious than men – here's the science","headings":"Women are far more anxious than men – here’s the science\nWomen are far more anxious than men – here’s the science\nAuthor\nDisclosure statement\nPartners\nrepublish_panel.title\nWhy women?\nThe anxious West\nWhat can be done?\nWant to write?\n","segment":"To do this, we conducted a systematic review of studies that reported on the proportion of people with anxiety in a variety of contexts around the world, and used rigorous methods to retain the highest quality studies. Our results showed that women are almost twice as likely to suffer from anxiety as men, and that people living in Europe and North America are disproportionately affected. Why women? But why are women more likely to experience anxiety than men? It could be because of differences in brain chemistry and hormone fluctuations. Reproductive events across a woman’s life are associated with hormonal changes, which have been linked to anxiety. The surge in oestrogen and progesterone that occurs during pregnancy can increase the risk for obsessive compulsive disorder, characterised by disturbing and repetitive thoughts, impulses and obsessions that are distressing and debilitating. But in addition to biological mechanisms, women and men seem to experience and react to events in their life differently. Women tend to be more prone to stress, which can increase their anxiety. Also, when faced with stressful situations, women and men tend to use different coping strategies.","start_char":1464,"end_char":2658}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_35_354139853#3_898123371","score":13.7141,"doc":{"url":"https://www.bustle.com/articles/83245-do-women-suffer-mental-illness-more-than-men-8-factors-behind-the-gender-imbalance-in-treatment","title":"Do Women Suffer Mental Illness More Than Men? 8 Factors Behind The Gender Imbalance In Treatment","headings":"Why Do Women Suffer Mental Illness More Than Men?\nWhy Do Women Suffer Mental Illness More Than Men?\n1.

This difference in structure is likely why men are more prone to think things through (even unconsciously) before experiencing their feelings of pain, while women's brains are more geared toward experiencing pain faster, says Teitelbaum. Plus, brain scans show that opposite sides of the brain light up when women experience pain compared to men. 2. Women have fewer pain blockers. It takes twice as much morphine to squelch pain for females as it does for males, according to studies. Why? Women don't have as many mu opioid receptors, which act like terminals to usher in feel-good endorphins to reduce pain. 3.

One is biological. Body fat content is 25% for women at normal size compared to 15% for men. All other things being equal, such as age and exercise levels, women require fewer calories per pound of body weight daily than do men. Female hormones make it easier to convert fat into food. Women more often do the cooking in the households. Finally, in fat-prone women, birth control pills cause the body to produce increased amounts of fat and water. Estrogen alone will cause increased deposition of fat. Anyone on the pill needs to decrease caloric intake by at least 10% in order to maintain the same weight.

McGarvey’s presentation at AAPS PharmSci360 detailed how an operational control strategy can be a key step in accomplishing quality by design, and how a first principles based approach can improve efficacy and efficiency in manufacturing. The first principles of engineering are foundational propositions and assumptions that cannot be inferred from any other theory. “First principles are like the rules of the game, the problem with nature is that nature is an infallible referee. When you play football, you can get away with breaking the rules now and again – nature isn’t like that,” ​ explained McGarvey.","start_char":0,"end_char":4125}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_18_517882402#29_581774630","score":10.0192,"doc":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetEase","title":"NetEase - Wikipedia","headings":"NetEase\nNetEase\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nContents\nHistory\nLicensed online games\nGames developed or published\nMain page: Category:NetEase games\nReferences\nExternal links\n","segment":"The Lord of the Rings: Rise to War Mobile Game Announced\".

We are constantly interacting with Knowledge Graphs on a daily basis. However, Knowledge Graphs and underlying graph databases are still a mystery to most and because of its seamless entrance into our lives, most of us aren’t even aware of how dependent we are on the technology – or worse, how we have come to expect a certain quality and standard that we are now accustomed to. Many organizations are already using Knowledge Graph technology to help themselves stay ahead of the game. And Knowledge Graphs and graph databases have been in use for all types of industries, ranging from banking, the auto industry, oil and gas to pharmaceutical and health, retail, publishing, the media and more. Although these companies use Knowledge Graphs for different use cases, the end game is the same: taking large amounts of data from various data silos and adding value to it so that it can be used (and ultimately re-used) in a meaningful and more intelligent way.

It also includes technologies that are designed to improve and repair brain function and allow researchers and clinicians to visualize the brain.

The advent of brain imaging revolutionized the field, allowing researchers to directly monitor the brain's activities during experiments. Neurotechnology has made significant impact on society, though its presence is so commonplace that many do not realize its ubiquity. From pharmaceutical drugs to brain scanning, neurotechnology affects nearly all industrialized people either directly or indirectly, be it from drugs for depression, sleep, ADD, or anti-neurotics to cancer scanning, stroke rehabilitation, and much more. As the field's depth increases it will potentially allow society to control and harness more of what the brain does and how it influences lifestyles and personalities. Commonplace technologies already attempt to do this; games like BrainAge, and programs like Fast ForWord that aim to improve brain function, are neurotechnologies. Currently, modern science can image nearly all aspects of the brain as well as control a degree of the function of the brain.","start_char":0,"end_char":2072}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_30_722485564#3_1648118123","score":9.6732,"doc":{"url":"https://topforeignstocks.com/foreign-adrs-list/the-full-list-of-israel-adrs/","title":"The Complete List of Israel Stocks Trading on US Markets | TopForeignStocks.com","headings":"The Complete List of Israel Stocks Trading on US Markets\nThe Complete List of Israel Stocks Trading on US Markets","segment":"Electromedical & Electrotherapeutic Apparatus\n32\nItamar Medical Ltd.\nITMR\nMedical/Dental Instruments\n33\nIturan Location and Control Ltd.\nITRN\nElectronic Components\n34\nKamada Ltd.\nKMDA\nMajor Pharmaceuticals\n35\nKornit Digital Ltd.\nKRNT\nIndustrial Machinery/Components\n36\nKitov Pharma Ltd.\nKTOV\nMajor Pharmaceuticals\n37\nMagal Security Systems Ltd.\nMAGS\nTelecommunications Equipment\n38a\nMicrobot Medical Inc.\nMBOT\nBiotechnology: Biological Products\n38b\nMeaTech 3D Ltd\nMITC\nFood Producers\n39\nMedigus Ltd.\nMDGS\nMedical/Dental Instruments\n40\nMediWound Ltd.\nMDWD\nSpecialty Chemicals\n41\nMagic Software Enterprises Ltd.\nMGIC\nComputer Software: Prepackaged Software\n42\nMIND C.T.I.

This includes some of the largest and best-known companies in the world, such as Pfizer Inc. ( PFE ), Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK ), and AbbVie Inc. ( ABBV ). A number of pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, have seen a surge in their sales after winning approval from U.S. and foreign governments for vaccines aimed at preventing the COVID-19 virus. Over the last 12 months, pharmaceutical stocks, based on the iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF ( IHE ), have lagged behind the overall market. IHE's total return over the period was 29.7% compared to the Russell 1000's 48.3% return. 1 The latter's performance is as of March 10, and the IHE's total return and statistics in the tables below are as of March 11. Here are the top 3 pharmaceutical stocks with the best value, the fastest growth, and the most momentum. Best Value Pharmaceutical Stocks\nThese are the pharmaceutical stocks with the lowest 12-month trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Because profits can be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, a low P/E ratio shows you’re paying less for each dollar of profit generated.

REGULATORY AND VALIDATION\nWHAT IS PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATORY COMPLIANCE? FDA ensures the quality of drug products by carefully monitoring if drug manufacturers adhere to pharmaceutical regulatory compliance per Current Good Manufacturing (cGMP. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a drug product. The regulations make sure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. WHAT IS PHARMACEUTICAL VALIDATION? Validation is a requirement of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). As defined by FDA's 1987 Guideline on General Principles of Process Validation, validation - such as pharmaceutical validation - is \"Establishing documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance that a specific process will consistently produce a product, meeting its pre-determined specifications and quality attributes.\" Click on any Course for More Information\nCourse Type\nScheduled","start_char":1809,"end_char":3070}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_14_653631580#1_1351905628","score":9.2771,"doc":{"url":"https://collegedunia.com/university/25947-indian-institute-of-technology-iit-bhu-varanasi/courses-fees","title":"Indian Institute of Technology - [IIT BHU], Varanasi Courses & Fees 2021-2022","headings":"Indian Institute of Technology - [IIT BHU], Varanasi - Course & Fees Details\nIndian Institute of Technology - [IIT BHU], Varanasi - Course & Fees Details\nIndian Institute of Technology - [IIT BHU], Varanasi Fees & Eligibility\nIndian Institute of Technology - [IIT BHU] Top Courses, Fees & Eligibility\nMaster of Pharmacy [M.Pharm]\n9.0 /10 Based on 1 Reviews 1 Questions Answered\nQues.

Researchers first discovered mRNA in the late 1960s, but only within the past couple of decades has work been done to utilize the discovery to cure disease. This is the first time the federal government has approved usage of the technology in humans. Sandro da Rocha, Ph.D., a director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering and Sciences at Virginia Commonwealth University, researches nanomedicines for drug delivery including the use of RNA and said he believes the vaccine is safe and effective. The mRNA breaks down quickly and does not have a lasting impact on the body like something based on DNA. da Rocha, a professor in the Department of Pharmaceutics at the VCU School of Pharmacy and in the Department of Chemical and Life Science Engineering at the VCU College of Engineering, is more concerned about people being willing to take the vaccine, not the mRNA itself. He discussed these concerns, and shared more about mRNA, in an interview with VCU News. How does the vaccine technology work? This new vaccine technology consists of a nanomedicine platform.","start_char":1015,"end_char":2453}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_17_2955623439#1_3141708949","score":9.1892,"doc":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mexican_inventions_and_discoveries","title":"List of Mexican inventions and discoveries - Wikipedia","headings":"List of Mexican inventions and discoveries\nList of Mexican inventions and discoveries\nContents\nPre-Hispanic\nMusical instruments\nArt\nCalendrics\nEngineering\nMetal production\nGames\\entertainment\nFood Preparation\nCrops and cultivation\nLivestock\nFashion\nDog breeds\nBody armor\nMedication\nMath\nSports\nBehavioral products\nChemical\nSocial\nCommerce\nAlcoholic beverages\nHealth\\Hygiene\nNavigation\nAstronomy\nColonial\nIndustrial\nEconomy\nFood\nMusic\\instruments\nAlcoholic beverages\nSports\nFashion\nRanching\\Farming\nChemical\nModern\nConstruction and civil engineering\nChemical\nAntidotes\nPharmaceutical\nAutomotive\nTransport\nAviation\nFirearms\nMilitary technology\nMusic/Instruments\nArt\nFood\nGames/celebration\nDog breeds\nAlcoholic beverages\nModern technologies\nSurvailance technologies\nComunications\nSports\nPolitical\nIndustrial\nMedical\nDiscoveries\nReferences\n","segment":"You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.

Painting – Classic period Maya paintings, found in the archaeological sites of Cacaxtla and Bonampak, are some of the most refined paintings ever to come out of the ancient Americas. Besides the Maya, other indigenous civilizations were also known for their wall paintings, including the Aztec, who developed the art of sand painting. Pottery – many indigenous American cultures and peoples independently invented and then refined pottery in the Americas into fine works of art, as well for utilitarian usage.

Further, their use in humans was associated with several complications.","start_char":0,"end_char":853}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_08_1114325935#2_1993560807","score":9.1694,"doc":{"url":"http://www.pharmatutor.org/articles/pharmaceutical-products-of-recombinant-dna-technology-an-overview","title":"PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY: AN OVERVIEW | PharmaTutor","headings":"PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY: AN OVERVIEW\nPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY: AN OVERVIEW\nSearch this website\n","segment":"For instance, administration of pig insulin to diabetic patients results in the development of antibodies. The advent of recombinant DNA technology heralded a new chapter for the production of a wide range of therapeutic agents in sufficient quantities for human use. The commercial exploitation of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology began in late 1970s by biotechnological companies to produce proteins. There are around 400 different proteins being produced by rDNAtechnologyand as of now around 30 have been approved for human use. REFERENCE ID: PHARMATUTOR-ART-1866\nRecombinant DNA technology involves using microorganisms, macroscopic organisms, or hybrids of tumor cells and leukocytes: to create new pharmaceuticals; to create safer and/or more effective versions of conventionally produced pharmaceuticals; and\nto produce substances identical to conventionally made pharmaceuticals more cost-effectively than the latter pharmaceuticals are produced.

The transparent material used in manufacturing Organ-on-a-Chip enables real-time imaging and monitoring of the cells. Also, fluid flow in microfluidic channels in the vicinity of the cells allows nutrients, medicine, cytokines, etc. to be delivered to the cells besides exposing them to the natural shear forces and flow dynamics of the body. How does Organ-on-a-Chip work? In principle, an organ-on-a-chip consists of a main microchamber lined with human cell lines connected to a network of microchannels for perfusion and waste withdrawal. The chamber is made of a biocompatible material. Normally, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used for creating these microchambers. PDMS is the most-widely used polymer used in the microfluidic industry due to its superior properties such as simple and standard fabrication methods, biocompatibility, optical transparency, nontoxicity, compressibility and permeability to gases.

While the vaccine was developed in a matter of months, it was based on decades of research. Unlike traditional vaccines where a weakened or inactive form of the virus or pieces of a viral protein is injected into a person, the coronavirus vaccine utilizes messenger RNA technology. mRNA is a single-strand molecule of RNA that corresponds to the genetic sequence that codes for the production of proteins and can be used to transport information to a cell. Researchers first discovered mRNA in the late 1960s, but only within the past couple of decades has work been done to utilize the discovery to cure disease. This is the first time the federal government has approved usage of the technology in humans. Sandro da Rocha, Ph.D., a director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering and Sciences at Virginia Commonwealth University, researches nanomedicines for drug delivery including the use of RNA and said he believes the vaccine is safe and effective.","start_char":0,"end_char":1885}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_56_325942491#4_706410942","score":9.04,"doc":{"url":"https://www.ufluidix.com/microfluidics-applications/organ-on-a-chip/","title":"Organ-on-a-Chip: microfluidic technology that can revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry","headings":"Organ-on-a-Chip: Microfluidic technology that can revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry\nOrgan-on-a-Chip: Microfluidic technology that can revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry\nWhat is Organ-on-a-Chip?\nWhy is Organ-on-a-Chip important?\nHow does Organ-on-a-Chip work?\nWhere can I buy Organ-on-a-Chip?\n","segment":"The technology needs to upgrade to enable taking advantage of complex microenvironments at high-throughput.

Determinism is often contrasted with free will, although some philosophers claim that the two are compatible. Determinism often is taken to mean causal determinism, which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below. Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or multiverse ). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).

When Augustine first addressed the problem of free will, he was responding to an early formulation of the problem that focused on sinful actions.

Presence, or the ability to see collaborators, is one aspect of both Teams and Skype for Business, and it now works with coexistence modes. Coexistence mode settings determine who can call or chat with others in an organization or outside of an organization when using Teams and Skype for Business client applications. Here's one explanation of how coexistence modes affect Teams and Skype for Business end users, per this Microsoft document: When deployed in specific coexistence modes, Teams and Skype for Business can interoperate, enabling users to chat with and call one another, and ensuring that communications remain fluid across your organization during your upgrade journey to Teams. Coexistence modes govern interoperability. The coexistence mode of the receiver determines whether interoperability will be available. Coexistence Modes Basics\nIn a nutshell, there are three basic coexistence modes settings (along with variants), according to this Microsoft document: Islands mode -- for using Teams and Skype for Business simultaneously\nSkype for Business only mode -- for organizations that want to use Skype for Business only\nTeams only mode -- for organizations that want to use teams only\nMicrosoft typically recommends that organizations making the transition to Teams should first start out in Islands mode, using both Teams and Skype for Business concurrently, which is the default setting.

Determinism should not be confused with self-determination of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism is about interactions which affect our cognitive processes in our life. It is about the cause and the result of what we have done in our life. Cause and result are always bounded together in our cognitive processes. It assumes that if an observer has sufficient information about an object or human being, that such an observer might be able to predict every consequent move of that object or human being.

Does it matter? The next question revolves around determining whether making a change will really make a difference to the company. As an example, let’s imagine you are on a board where the level of executive stock ownership is very high. Now let’s imagine that ISS or Glass Lewis criticize the company because there are no stock-ownership guidelines. Is there any harm in implementing guidelines, given that the executives easily reach market-competitive levels of ownership? If the answer to the question is no (and in this example, it probably is), then it is probably best to go ahead and implement the guidelines.

Equalizing mechanisms reduce fitness differences between species, or relative competitive ability in the absence of niche differentiation.

Sufficient settlement with little disturbances yields a habitat that has a stable population.

In some cases/communities, the equilibrium point can not be determined because the community is never at an unchanging equilibrium; an example of such a situation is the predator and prey systems.

The new presence capability is getting added via an update that is rolling out to Office 365 tenancies. The rollout started on Tuesday but \"it may take up to a day for the update to affect some users,\" explained Rahul Kayala, a product manager for Teams, in the announcement. Coexistence modes are settings for IT pros to use that are designed address problems organizations may face when either shifting from Skype for Business to Teams or trying to use both solutions concurrently. Microsoft currently supports both Teams and Skype for Business as collaboration solutions, but it announced last year that Teams will be the client it plans to support going forward. In August, Microsoft claimed that Teams had sufficient capabilities to serve as a replacement client for the Skype for Business client for organizations. Presence, or the ability to see collaborators, is one aspect of both Teams and Skype for Business, and it now works with coexistence modes. Coexistence mode settings determine who can call or chat with others in an organization or outside of an organization when using Teams and Skype for Business client applications. Here's one explanation of how coexistence modes affect Teams and Skype for Business end users, per this Microsoft document: When deployed in specific coexistence modes, Teams and Skype for Business can interoperate, enabling users to chat with and call one another, and ensuring that communications remain fluid across your organization during your upgrade journey to Teams.","start_char":0,"end_char":1926}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_44_1593230276#1_3292889079","score":9.4154,"doc":{"url":"https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/executive-education/the-kellogg-experience/thought-leadership/iss-glass-lewis.aspx","title":"How Can Boards Coexist with ISS and Glass Lewis?","headings":"How Can Boards Coexist with ISS and Glass Lewis?\nThought Leadership\nHow Can Boards Coexist with ISS and Glass Lewis?\nWhat are ISS and Glass Lewis?\nA Framework for Coexisting\nCorporate Governance\n","segment":"What are ISS and Glass Lewis? ISS and Glass Lewis are the two most prominent proxy advisory services, at least in North America. Because institutional investors sometimes hold hundreds or thousands of different stocks at a point in time, they tend to need assistance in voting their shares come annual meeting time. This is where ISS and Glass Lewis come in. Both firms have created models of what they think good governance looks like. And both use various algorithms to determine whether a given company is deserving of a “yes” vote on Say on Pay, and whether individual board members should be supported. Many institutions follow their recommendations, while others subscribe to the services yet also employ their own staff to determine how they should vote their shares. The most interesting thing about these firms is that their business model requires them to change their guidelines on a regular basis. After all, if they had a straightforward set of rules and all companies adopted them, there would then be no need for ISS or Glass Lewis to exist.

Immanuel Kant suggested that the basic rule of determinism is one of the rules by which we must interpret every experience. If a person dies of lung cancer because he or she smoked their entire life against the advice of their doctor, smoking is obviously the cause behind that death.

This is not surprising, because the status of human free will has implications for moral responsibility, personal identity, and epistemology. Most people, however, do not fully understand the implications of the free will question for theology. Take, for example, Christian notions of salvation. A complete understanding of the nature of salvation within the Christian faith must contain sin, generally defined as any deed that is contrary to God’s eternal law. [ i] Christianity holds that humanity chose to break these eternal laws, therefore separating humanity from God.

Subsets of the naturalist view include the materialist and physicalist positions, which hold that humans are entirely physical.","start_char":6571,"end_char":7742}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_29_729729267#7_1687004179","score":9.0941,"doc":{"url":"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/client-connectivity-in-an-exchange-2016-coexistence-environment/ba-p/603945","title":"Client Connectivity in an Exchange 2016 Coexistence Environment with Exchange 2010 - Microsoft Tech Community","headings":"Client Connectivity in an Exchange 2016 Coexistence Environment with Exchange 2010\nClient Connectivity in an Exchange 2016 Coexistence Environment with Exchange 2010\nExisting Environment\nAutodiscover\nInternal Outlook Connectivity\nOutlook Anywhere\nOutlook Web App\nExchange ActiveSync\nExchange Web Services\nClient Connectivity with Exchange 2016 in Site1\nAutodiscover\nInternal Outlook Connectivity\nExternal Outlook Anywhere & MAPI/HTTP Connectivity\nOutlook on the web\nExchange ActiveSync\nExchange Web Services\nOffline Address Book\nHow MBX2016 Picks a Target Legacy Exchange Server\nIMAP & POP Coexistence\nConclusion\n6 Comments\nAbdul Farooque\n","segment":"CAS2010 in Site1 will authenticate the user, do a service discovery, and determine that the mailbox is located within Site3, which does not contain any OWA ExternalURLs.

Coexistence theory is a framework to understand how competitor traits can maintain species diversity and stave-off competitive exclusion even among similar species living in ecologically similar environments. Coexistence theory explains the stable coexistence of species as an interaction between two opposing forces: fitness differences between species, which should drive the best-adapted species to exclude others within a particular ecological niche, and stabilizing mechanisms, which maintains diversity via niche differentiation. For many species to be stabilized in a community, population growth must be negative density-dependent, i.e. all participating species have a tendency to increase in density as their populations decline. In such communities, any species that becomes rare will experience positive growth, pushing its population to recover and making local extinction unlikely. As the population of one species declines, individuals of that species tend to compete predominantly with individuals of other species. Thus, the tendency of a population to recover as it declines in density reflects reduced intraspecific competition (within-species) relative to interspecific competition (between-species), the signature of niche differentiation (see Lotka-Volterra competition ).

As mentioned by Michel Martin from the Faith Matters show, “religion is about the why. Science may be about the how” (NPR News, 2010). In my opinion, this makes perfect sense. I feel that when a child is born, they are automatically placed in a religion in which their parents believe. At that time, no one could tell the child anything different because that is all they know. As the child experience life as an adolescent, their fate and belief, will be tested giving room for questions to be asked and applied to science. Guest speaker Professor Francisco Ayala mentioned that, “the world is one and the same but what we see through those windows is different” (NPR News, 2010). In the early stages in life, what a person is groomed to believe is what they will continue to believe.

For the common situation in which extrapyramidal (parkinsonian) motor dysfunction accompanies dementia, there is a therapeutic dilemma since the most frequently used drugs to treat the behavioral problems, neuroleptic antipsychotics, can worsen parkinsonism and have been associated with severe extrapyramidal reactions in some types of dementia. To date, the efficacy and tolerability of a promising alternative medication class to treat psychosis and agitation, namely atypical antipsychotics, has not been tested in patients with a primary dementia selected for coexisting parkinsonism. This is a multicenter double-blind, controlled clinical trial in which 60 subjects with a primary dementia (probable Alzheimer's disease [AD] or probable dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]) and coexisting parkinsonism, or Parkinson's disease with dementia [PDD] will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: ( 1) quetiapine (QUET); an atypical antipsychotic with a favorable extrapyramidal side effect profile), or (2) placebo.","start_char":915,"end_char":2735}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_798492193#5_1828056616","score":9.0765,"doc":{"url":"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/coexisting","title":"Coexisting - definition of coexisting by The Free Dictionary","headings":"coexisting\ncoexisting\nco·ex·ist\nco′ex·is′tence n.\nco′ex·is′tent adj.\nMentioned in ?\nDictionary browser ?\nFull browser ?\n","segment":"Mentioned in ? accompany\napprehension\narrangement\nastral\nbe\ncoexist\nco-exist\ncoexistence\ncoexistent\ncohabit\ncohabitant\ncohabitation\ncohabiter\ncoincide\ncomorbid\ncomorbidity\ncompossibility\nconcurrent\nconsubstantiation\nDictionary browser ? ▲\nCoestablishment\nCoestate\nCoetanean\ncoetaneity\ncoetaneous\ncoeternal\ncoeternity\nCoetzee\nCoeur\nCoeur d'Alene\nCoeur d'Alene Lake\ncoeval\ncoevalneity\ncoevals\ncoevolution\ncoevolutionary\ncoevolve\nCoevous\ncoexecutor\nCoexecutrix\ncoexert\ncoexist\nco-exist\ncoexistence\ncoexistent\ncoexisting\ncoextend\ncoextension\ncoextensive\nco-extensive\ncofactor\ncofavorite\ncofeature\ncoff\nCoffea\nCoffea arabica\nCoffea canephora\nCoffea liberica\nCoffea robusta\ncoffee\ncoffee bag\ncoffee bar\ncoffee bean\ncoffee berry\ncoffee blight\ncoffee break\nCoffee bug\ncoffee cake\ncoffee can\ncoffee cappuccino\ncoffee cream\n▼\nFull browser ? ▲\nCoexecutrix\ncoexert\ncoexist\ncoexist\ncoexist\ncoexist with\ncoexist with (someone or something)\ncoexist with her\ncoexist with him\ncoexist with it\ncoexist with me\ncoexist with one\ncoexist with them\ncoexist with us\ncoexist with you\ncoexisted\ncoexisted\ncoexisted\ncoexistence\ncoexistence\ncoexistence\nCoexistence of Animal Rights on Earth\nCoexistence Technical Advisory Group\ncoexistences\ncoexistences\ncoexistent\ncoexistent\ncoexistent\ncoexistently\ncoexistently\ncoexisting\nCoexisting Current Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder\ncoexistingly\ncoexists\ncoexists\ncoextend\ncoextended\ncoextending\ncoextends\ncoextension\ncoextensive\ncoextensively\ncoextrusion\nCoextrusion Welding\nCOF\nCofA\nCOFAA\nCoFaB\nCOFAC\nCOFACE\nCOFACE\ncofactor\ncofactor\ncofactor\ncofactor\ncofactor\ncofactor of thromboplastin\ncofactor of thromboplastin\ncofactor of thromboplastin\nCofactor Required for SP-1 activation\nCofactors\n▼\nComplete English Grammar Rules\nis now available in paperback and eBook formats.

The Varying States of Water\nWater coexists with oil in either a dissolved or a free state. When single water molecules are distributed throughout the oil due to the water's chemical attraction to the fluid, it is in a dissolved state. Numerous factors such as viscosity, base stock type and condition, impurities, and additive package determine the volume of water that will be dissolved by the oil. Additionally, the dissolved volume is a function of the oil's temperature, thus the humidity is reported as relative humidity (depending on the temperature). If the oil has dissolved all of the water possible at a given temperature, it is saturated. Dissolved water is difficult to control but causes only minimal harm to the machine and oil. When the saturated oil experiences a temperature decrease, it reaches a point where water will not condense into a free form. This is called the dew point temperature. Free water is the other state in which water coexists with the oil.","start_char":809,"end_char":1881}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_25_1273768355#15_2396042062","score":8.9778,"doc":{"url":"https://pairedlife.com/relationships/lust-love-and-respect","title":"Can Love and Lust Coexist in a Relationship? - PairedLife","headings":"Can Love and Lust Coexist in a Relationship?\nCan Love and Lust Coexist in a Relationship?\nWhat Is Lust?\nWhat Is Love?\nThe Science Behind Lust and Love\nFalling in Lust\nFalling in Love\nIt's Complicated . . .\nThe \"R\" Word\nThe Dilemma of Love, Lust, and Respect\nWhy Respect and Lust Is Confusing\nHow Lust Transforms Into Love\nCommon Questions\nIs lust important in a relationship?\nHow do I know if it's love or lust?\nHow long does lust last in a relationship?\nSo, Can Love and Lust Coexist in a Relationship?\nReader Survey . . .\nQuestions & Answers\n© 2012 Glenn Stok\nIf this inspired you, share your thoughts . . .\n","segment":"The premise of this discussion is to determine how respect can hinder the strong emotional feelings of lust that can help make a healthy relationship romantic.

These two factors have been termed equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms, respectively. Equalizing mechanisms reduce fitness differences between species, or relative competitive ability in the absence of niche differentiation. As its name implies, it works by making similar species more equal in their competitive ability. For example, when multiple species compete for the same resource, competitive ability is determined by the minimum level of resources a species needs to maintain itself (known as an R*, or equilibrium resource density). Thus, the species with the lowest R* is the best competitor and excludes all other species in the absence of any niche differentiation. Any factor that reduces R*s between species (like increased harvest of the dominant competitor) is classified as an equalizing mechanism. For species to coexist, fitness differences must be overcome by stabilizing mechanisms. Stabilizing mechanisms promote coexistence by concentrating intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition. There are large number of named stabilizing mechanisms including classical hypotheses of species coexistence.","start_char":1903,"end_char":3147}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_01_678178505#1_673311006","score":8.9585,"doc":{"url":"http://exchangequery.com/2014/09/12/readiness-to-migrate-lotus-notes-to-office-365-with-quest-co-existence-manager/","title":"Migrate from Lotus notes to Office 365 with Quest Co-Existence Manager | EzCloudInfo","headings":"Migrate from Lotus notes to Office 365 with Quest Co-Existence Manager\nMigrate from Lotus notes to Office 365 with Quest Co-Existence Manager\nhttp://www.v-and-m.com/vmhomepage.nsf/Content/Microsoft’s+%22Secret%22+Mail+Migration+Tool+?OpenDocument\nOverview of Quest Coexistence Manager\nWhat this software does?\nDirectory Coexistence Role:\nMail Co-Existence Role:\nFree/Busy Co-Existence Role:\nQcalCON\nPrerequisites:\nSource Servers should be the following:\nSupported Domino Server versions\nTarget servers should be the following:\nSQL Servers Required\nLicensing Quest Software:\nCoexistence between Notes and Office 365\nIn order to achieve perform the following\nPost navigation\n","segment":"In order to accomplish this we have multiple third party solutions through which we can integrate.

A nonprofit organization, on the other hand, has other goals in mind. Still, that doesn’t mean nonprofits can’t make money and that its employees can’t earn a paycheck. How Nonprofits Make Money\nEvery organization needs money to pay for daily operations, even a nonprofit. With an income stream, nonprofits can pay for office space, equipment and employees to support daily operations. Generated funds also pay for travel and marketing expenses related to getting the word out about what you’re doing.

They are registered as 501 (c) organizations with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and by extension, they are exempted from paying tax on any income they earn from any source, as long as the funds go into the support of the organization. Even if a 501 (c) organization brings in more income than it spends, they are not required to pay tax on the excess revenue, which must be ploughed back into the nonprofit in order to support and strengthen its mission. In other words, the excess proceeds are not distributed among shareholders or owners like a conventional business. Even though a nonprofit organization itself cannot earn a taxable profit, the staff who run it can receive a taxable salary. Nonprofit organizations, just like a regular organization incur administrative costs, which include not only expenses like paying rent and utilities, but also compensating the staff that runs the organization.

They are registered as 501 (c) organizations with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which means they do not pay tax on any funds they earn or are given, so long as those funds support the organization’s mission.

In other words, the excess proceeds are not distributed among shareholders or owners as they would be in a for-profit company. If you wish to set up a nonprofit, be sure to read about all the steps necessary for compliance with state and federal laws. In addition to registering with the IRS, you will need to incorporate (if you wish to be a corporation), and you may have to register lobbying and fundraising activities.

Nonprofits have to make money if they want to grow, thrive, and continue serving the community. There are several types of nonprofits, according to the IRS, and depending on its type, a nonprofit may have different income streams than another. Nonprofits make money in a variety of ways, and they often must seek multiple income mixes to do their work. Most money made by nonprofits is put back into the organization to keep it (and its programs) running to fulfill its societal purpose.

You are allowed to use a portion of that money to pay yourself and anyone who works for you. Not all of the money has to be used towards its intended purposes. People know that it costs money to run a charity and they understand when you have expenses.

Where the money comes from\nNonprofits have to raise money to do whatever charitable work they have planned. You can apply for grants and hold fundraisers to bring in the money needed to run the company and pay your salary. Your organization can also earn money through business ventures, such as renting property, selling donated merchandise, and making investments. But if your nonprofit makes money in ways that are unrelated to its mission, the income from those activities will be taxable. For example, if your nonprofit is set up to distribute food to the homeless, but raises funds by buying and selling used cars, those funds will likely be considered taxable by the IRS. Watch your costs\nIf you wish to create a nonprofit and pay yourself for working for it, you do need to be judicious about managing your costs. In general, nonprofits that spend less than a third of their funds on their charitable mission are evaluated poorly by sites like Charity Navigator. If you hope to get donations and have people support your charity, you have to be able to show you are truly spending most of the money on the actual mission. And, as noted earlier, you can get in trouble with the IRS if you pay yourself (or your family and friends) unusually large salaries.","start_char":2276,"end_char":3599}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_30_356839620#13_829612016","score":10.4834,"doc":{"url":"https://thewealthcircle.com/ways-to-make-money-for-a-nonprofit-organization/","title":"7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization in 2021","headings":"7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization in 2021\n7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization in 2021\nWhat are Nonprofit Organizations?\n7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization\n#1 Tournaments\n#2 Product and Services Sales\n#3 Corporate Support\n#4 Grants\n#5 Donations\n#6 Fundraising event\n#7 Bequests\nConclusion\nReferences\nRecommendation\nIhejieto Victory\n","segment":"That sounds like reverse psychology, right?

What Is a Nonprofit? Essentially, a nonprofit organization is one whose main goal is something other than making money. These organizations can have a number of different missions based on their specific charters and how and why they were established. But the essential unifying factor is that they’re not set up to generate revenue like a traditional business does, which is usually through selling an item or service. Nonprofits are also tax-exempt, which means they don’t pay income tax on the money their organization brings in each year. For example, corporations must pay taxes on the money they make. Nonprofits, on the other hand, are exempt from paying taxes, in part because they’re not trying to generate a profit. There are eight federal government-approved categories that define nonprofits. To be classified as a nonprofit organization with the federal government and thus avoid paying taxes on property, donations, and any revenue, an organization must apply to the IRS for status as a 501 (c) (3).","start_char":969,"end_char":2114}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_50_241972855#16_491875756","score":10.2104,"doc":{"url":"https://www.profitableventure.com/non-profit-funded-make-money/","title":"11 Ways Nonprofits are Funded and How They Make Money - ProfitableVenture","headings":"11 Ways Nonprofits are Funded and How They Make Money\n11 Ways Nonprofits are Funded and How They Make Money\n11 Ways Nonprofits are Funded and How They Make Money\nIdentifying and Cultivating Major Donors\nAjaero Tony Martins\n","segment":"6. Trading: a lot of nonprofit organizations make money by selling goods and offering services to members, service users, the general public, or other organizations. Some nonprofit organizations even depend solely on this means to get all their funding. You have flexibility about how to spend your earned income. For example, the annual sale of Girl Scout cookies and Boy Scout popcorn are two of the highest profile product examples, bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars each year, much more than its fees from annual membership. The cookie sales have been a lucrative revenue stream for the Girl Scouts since the early 1900s, when the first cookies were said to have been sold.

Just think of a university that sells tickets to athletic events and artistic performances, charges tuition to students, and may have a medical center where patients and their insurance companies pay for medical services. Even small charities might run a thrift shop, while a well-established charity such as the Girl Scouts of the USA sells cookies. When it comes to earned income, the IRS groups nonprofit earned income into two categories: related business income and unrelated business income. If your nonprofit is tax-exempt under a 501 (c) (3) classification, most of the income you earn must be in line with your mission to avoid taxation.

Even though a nonprofit organization itself cannot earn a taxable profit, the staff who run it can receive a taxable salary. Nonprofit organizations, just like a regular organization incur administrative costs, which include not only expenses like paying rent and utilities, but also compensating the staff that runs the organization. Directors and officers of the nonprofit cannot be paid, but people who hold a position within the company can be. When you start a nonprofit organization, you can put yourself in any position you want within the company, with a salary you set. However, you should bear in mind that you can’t just give yourself a unlimited paycheck. The IRS expects that you’ll pay yourself reasonable compensation for the services you provide—and it judges reasonableness on the basis of comparable salaries for comparable organizations.

Nonprofit vs. Not-for-Profit\nNot-for-profit is a broad term that describes activities and organizations that do not aim to — or are prohibited from — earning a profit. As a simple example, walking your dog would be a not-for-profit activity since you don't do it to earn any money. If you started an organization to walk shelter dogs, you might be able to form a nonprofit that raises money, provided the money goes back into the organization. Nonprofits are generally organizations that take on social, environmental or economic missions. Well-known examples are The American Red Cross, The United Way and Habitat for Humanity. On the local level, food pantries and animal shelters operate as nonprofits. Not-for-profit organizations typically exist for activities that cater to special interests, such as business and trade organizations and amateur sports leagues. Volunteers vs. Paid Employees\nMany nonprofit organizations benefit from the work of volunteers, but there is no requirement that a nonprofit be exclusively run and staffed by volunteers.","start_char":1546,"end_char":2899}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_54_363753215#15_845553504","score":10.1663,"doc":{"url":"https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-do-nonprofits-make-money-4779842","title":"How Do Nonprofits Make Money?","headings":"How Do Nonprofits Make Money?\nNonprofit Organizations Resources\nHow Do Nonprofits Make Money?\nA healthy basket of income sources pays off\nNonprofit vs. For-Profit Income\nEarned Income\nRelated Activities\nUnrelated Activities\nHow Philanthropy Supports Charities\nIndividual Donations\nGrants From Corporations, Foundations, and the Government\nThe Bottom Line\nArticle Sources\n","segment":"Inurement/Private Benefit - Charitable Organizations .\" Accessed Dec. 23, 2019.

The people who operate nonprofits (usually known as founders) can make money by being paid by the nonprofit for their work, but they don't receive additional compensation, based on how much money the organization generates, as is often the case at for-profit businesses. Who Designates Nonprofit Organizations? The line between for-profit and non-profit entities can be confusing. For example, many hospitals and educational institutes are nonprofits, despite the fact that it seems like they generate lots of money.

If they do not receive any additional financial incentive to do so—for example, a government subsidy or a “corporate giving” PR campaign—banks typically will not lend to a nonprofit that is not bringing in significant revenues.

If you started an organization to walk shelter dogs, you might be able to form a nonprofit that raises money, provided the money goes back into the organization.","start_char":1183,"end_char":2288}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_30_356839620#12_829610265","score":10.0236,"doc":{"url":"https://thewealthcircle.com/ways-to-make-money-for-a-nonprofit-organization/","title":"7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization in 2021","headings":"7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization in 2021\n7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization in 2021\nWhat are Nonprofit Organizations?\n7 ways to make money for a Nonprofit Organization\n#1 Tournaments\n#2 Product and Services Sales\n#3 Corporate Support\n#4 Grants\n#5 Donations\n#6 Fundraising event\n#7 Bequests\nConclusion\nReferences\nRecommendation\nIhejieto Victory\n","segment":"Similarly, there are individual donations from partners and non-partners alike.

It seems to happen in almost every game. The reasons why this happens can be varied and sometimes complicated. In this article, we’ll look at those reasons and hopefully explain the motivation behind them. There are 5 reasons why soccer players fake injuries: To attract the referee’s attention\nTo create a potential goal-scoring opportunity\nTo waste time\nTo punish another player\nTo attempt to regain possession of the ball\nRegardless of how you feel about a soccer player pretending to be hurt, each of these reasons is valid in a player’s eyes at the moment they decide to flop. To understand why let’s look at each reason before explaining what the punishment is for a player who fakes an injury and why sometimes appearances can be deceptive. The Terminology Used in Soccer to Describe Faking an Injury\nBefore we do this I do need to quickly explain the different terms used in soccer for this as there are 4 main terms used to describe the same action. Faking an injury\nFlopping\nDiving\nand Simulation\nEach of these terms is used to describe the same action – falling to the ground with the aim of gaining an unfair advantage. However, option number 4 – simulation – is the most important one to be aware of as that is the official soccer term used.","start_char":0,"end_char":1497}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_29_1059484407#0_2408756378","score":11.8975,"doc":{"url":"https://the18.com/soccer-learning/do-soccer-players-wear-cups-and-would-it-even-help","title":"Do Soccer Players Wear Cups And Would It Even Help?","headings":"Do Soccer Players Wear Cups, And Would It Even Help?\nDo Soccer Players Wear Cups, And Would It Even Help?\nDo Soccer Players Wear Cups?\nWhy Don’t Soccer Players Wear Cups?\nVideos you might like\n","segment":"Do Soccer Players Wear Cups And Would It Even Help?

Travis Yoesting August 14, 2018\nDo soccer players wear cups? It’s a simple question with a simple answer, so maybe the query should be rephrased: Why don’t male soccer players wear cups? A cup is a piece of protective gear worn while playing certain sports to protect a player with male reproductive organs from injury or pain when receiving contact to the groin area. They are typically hard pieces of plastic, but can also be of the softer, more malleable variety.

Kicking a ball in various positions requires the body to be as nimble as possible. Soccer is a sport of grace, pace and being in the right place. Having an extra piece of plastic in your shorts as you run around the pitch is a sure way to slow you down. So maybe we should look at the question from another direction.

Understanding how to flop properly, can help increase your chances of getting a call to go your way. Conclusion\nAlthough we don’t recommend that anyone practices flopping, it’s not secret that it has become a large part of the game. We always recommend players play as hard as they can, within the rules, and good things will happen. Flopping is often frowned upon as a cheap tactic, and players will often be exposed by the referees if they flop and they don’t get the call. This is why we recommend not trying to show up the referees by faking an injury to get a call. Play hard and don’t put the game in the referees hands.

Do not make flopping or faking injuries a habit. Faking an injury too often will get you no calls from the referees. Flopping should be used in strategic situations, not throughout the game. Best Time To Flop During A Soccer Game\nWe don’t recommend flopping at any point in the game. Players will often flop when they are inside of the box in order to draw a penalty kick from the referees. Also, when the ball is close to free kick ( to shoot on net) territory, players may flop to give their team the opportunity good field position and a chance at a goal.

The only requirement is that a player may not wear anything that is considered dangerous. Whether or not an outfield player can wear gloves is not specifically mentioned in the rules and is up to the referee’s judgment whether the gloves a player is wearing are allowed within the rules.

It could be a distraction that prevents them from performing at their peak throughout a game. If you’re interested in what gloves a soccer player wears, let me quickly explain.

Matches & Leagues\nA soccer match lasts for roughly 90 minutes and is divided into two 45-minute halves. There is a 15-minute intermission called halftime between the two halves during which players can rest and coaches can discuss tactics. Both teams can have at most eleven players on the field, totaling up to 22 players at any given time. There is also a referee on the field who manages fouls and misconduct during the game. Two assistant referees cover either sideline to indicate when the ball goes out of play and which team gets possession. Coaches can make up to three substitutions per match and are only allowed to stand in a specified “technical area” to coach their players from the sideline. Bench players, the rest of the coaching staff, and medical personnel also reside on the sideline during games. Since the clock never stops running during a soccer match, matches often go on for slightly longer than 90 minutes due to “added time,” which is the time at the end of either half that referees add on to make up for stoppages in play during the game. Other than that, the team with more goals at the end of the game wins.","start_char":6884,"end_char":8147}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_59_823974207#4_1878934799","score":11.7539,"doc":{"url":"https://yoursoccerhome.com/the-reason-why-soccer-goalies-wear-different-colors/","title":"The Reason Why Soccer Goalies Wear Different Colors – Your Soccer Home","headings":"The Reason Why Soccer Goalies Wear Different Colors\nThe Reason Why Soccer Goalies Wear Different Colors\nDifferent Colors for Different Role\nDifferent rules apply to the goalie\nCan Goalkeepers Wear the Same Color?\nHow Do Soccer Goalies Choose Their Color?\nConclusion\n","segment":"And in the mayhem of a game that is sometimes all you have time for. This is the case for not only the players but the game officials also. Many referees and referee’s assistants don’t know the individual players and all they have to go on is the uniforms that the players are wearing. This is especially important with a goalie because the goalie has a different role to anyone else on their team and different rules apply to them than apply to the rest of the players on their team. Different rules apply to the goalie\nThe most obvious example of this is the fact that a goalie can use their hands to touch the soccer ball. No other player is permitted to do this and if they do they will receive a caution, or worse, be sent off of the soccer field. To find out more about Red and Yellow Cards in Soccer click here to go to my Guide to the Red Card in Soccer or click here to go to my Guide to the Yellow Card in Soccer. Because of the rules that apply solely to a goalie the referee needs to be able to quickly and clearly distinguish the goalie from the rest of the players on their team. Requiring a goalie to wear different colors to the rest of the team also restricts the team from changing what player is playing as goalie without the referee knowing. Although the rules of soccer allow a team to change their goalie part way through a game it has to be done during a stoppage in play and the referee has to be aware it is happening.

What happens to your hands in the cold\nIn cold temperatures, a human body’s natural response is to significantly reduce the flow of blood to the body’s extremities, such as the hands and feet. The body is doing its best to keep the blood in the main, central part of the body as that is where all the main organs are. This natural response leads to a rapid decrease in hand and foot temperature.

If a player has a great first touch then everything you do after that will be better. When a player focusses on their juggling and practices as often as they can they are indirectly working on their first touch and ball control. With every touch of the ball, they make they are developing their skills in this area. Learning and adapting their movements based on how the ball reacts and learning to direct the ball to go where they want it to. This will make any player better.

This means that the majority of players on a soccer team will play at full intensity for the full 90 minutes with only one break. Conclusion\nIt is clear from comparing the two sports that soccer is harder as it requires more stamina and endurance from a player than football does. Soccer is more tiring than football because the players need to keep performing at a higher level for longer than a football player does. They are also permitted far fewer breaks during a game and must keep going for longer. A Player’s Ability to Read the Game\nThe last area where I want to compare whether soccer and football are harder concerns a player’s mentality.

A Player’s Ability to Read the Game\nThe last area where I want to compare whether soccer and football are harder concerns a player’s mentality. In any sport, a player must be fully aware of what they are expected to do and then complete that task. But what is required of a player can vary depending on the sport. In football players often operate play by play. The coach will tell them what play to use, and then when that is completed, they will use another play from the playbook. The teams keep going like this throughout the game, and the play that is used will depend on the stage of the game and what is happening. In soccer, it’s more complicated. A coach will brief the team before a game starts. They will convey the tactics they want the team to use and explain how they expect the players to perform throughout the game.","start_char":8829,"end_char":9748}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_00_1338787110#7_2375084213","score":11.5733,"doc":{"url":"http://dearsportsfan.com/2013/09/11/why-do-people-like-soccer/","title":"Why Do People Like Soccer? - Dear Sports Fan","headings":"Why Do People Like Soccer?\nWhy Do People Like Soccer?\nPeople Like Soccer Because it is Incredibly Hard to Score\nPeople Like Soccer Because of the Buildup Before the Release\nPeople Like Soccer Because of its Teamwork and Fluid Play\nSome Other Reasons People Like Soccer\n","segment":"It’s not unusual for there to be a string of ten or even fifteen passes that lead up to a goal. There are absolutely star players but even they exist within a team frame-work. For every star striker (player who exists solely to score) there is a star playmaker whose greatness is seen most clearly in the passes he or she makes to teammates. If you watch a soccer match in person, try to sit farther up than you imagine is ideal. From there you will get a good view of how the twenty-two players on the field move in swoops and cycles. The play continues this way almost unimpeded for ninety minutes.

Because of the rules that apply solely to a goalie the referee needs to be able to quickly and clearly distinguish the goalie from the rest of the players on their team. Requiring a goalie to wear different colors to the rest of the team also restricts the team from changing what player is playing as goalie without the referee knowing. Although the rules of soccer allow a team to change their goalie part way through a game it has to be done during a stoppage in play and the referee has to be aware it is happening.

In other words, each one of the 211 national soccer associations has its own league system, which often includes multiple tiers that allow for fluidity between them via promotion and relegation. For example, in England, the top flight league consists of 20 teams. In the three leagues below that league, there are a total of 72 teams. Below those leagues, there are a seemingly infinite number of semi-professional and amateur leagues that a separate English soccer system governs but that still feeds teams into the higher leagues via promotion. So, although there are only 92 club teams that UEFA, and, in turn, FIFA, directly governs in England, the teams themselves are always changing due to promotion and relegation. This, however, is only England. Every national association, from Angola to Laos to Bonaire to Samoa, has its own system with multiple leagues and/or tiers and, thus, a sizable number of individual clubs.

Coaches can make up to three substitutions per match and are only allowed to stand in a specified “technical area” to coach their players from the sideline. Bench players, the rest of the coaching staff, and medical personnel also reside on the sideline during games. Since the clock never stops running during a soccer match, matches often go on for slightly longer than 90 minutes due to “added time,” which is the time at the end of either half that referees add on to make up for stoppages in play during the game. Other than that, the team with more goals at the end of the game wins. League games are allowed to end in draws, while cup competitions require games to be replayed at a later date or to continue into extra time and/or a penalty shootout. Cup competitions, or ties, also often have two legs so that teams can play each other in both teams’ stadiums. The winner of the tie is then determined based on the aggregate score of the two legs. If the aggregate score is a draw, the team with more away goals often advances.

Every other player on the team is matching but not the goalie who will often grab your attention in their brightly colored uniform. I want to explain to you the important reason why that is. Soccer goalies wear a different color uniform than the rest of the players on their team so that the game officials, players, and fans can instantly differentiate them from the rest of the players on the soccer field. The goalie needs to be easily identified as they perform a different role than the other players on their team. The unique role of a goalie means they need to be easily identified, but their choice of colors and the reason for it is worth looking into in a bit more detail. You may be surprised by what you find out. Different Colors for Different Role\nIn every game of soccer you watch or play in, the goalie will be wearing a different color uniform than those around them. Soccer may be a team game but when it comes to the uniform the goalie is on their own. The basic reason for this is because the Laws of the Game that govern soccer worldwide make it clear that things have to be this way.","start_char":0,"end_char":1418}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_04_63982179#10_167086866","score":11.529,"doc":{"url":"http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_soccer_shoes_and_soccer_cleats","title":"What is the difference between soccer shoes and soccer cleats? - Answers","headings":"\nWhat is the difference between soccer shoes and soccer cleats?\nYour Answer\nWhat is the difference between soccer shoes and soccer cleats?\nRelated Questions\nWhat's the difference between indoor and out door soccer shoes?\nWhat are soccer shoes called?\nWhat is the difference between kids baseball and soccer shoes?\nWhat is soccer shoes commonly called?\nWhere can I find Ronaldinho's 10r Fg soccer cleats in Canada?\nWhat is the difference between football baseball and soccer cleats?\nDoes academy.com carry track shoes and cleats for soccer?\nDo soccer cleats protect the body when playing soccer?\nWhat are soccer shoes are called?\nWhat is the difference between cleats and tennis shoes?\nCan you use soccer cleats in football?\nCan you wash soccer cleats?\nWhat is the difference between futsal and indoor soccer shoes?\nWhat is the relationship between cleats and shoes?\nDo you need different cleats for indoors soccer?\nWhat is the difference between a football shoe and a soccer shoe?\nWhats the difference between rugby boots and soccer cleats?\nWhy soccer cleats increase your speed oppposed to tennis shoes and flip flops?\nWhat is the difference between soccer shoes and baseball shoes?\nThe first soccer cleats were made of?\nWhat kind of shoes do you use for soccer?\nWhat did soccer players wear before cleats?\nAre baseball cleats different then soccer cleats?\nWhat kind of shoes do you where in indoor soccer?\nDoes yellow shoes mean a soccer player is good?\n","segment":"Depending on which position a player plays in rugby, their boots may be as light as soccer cleats  (most backs) or heavier and sturdier (forwards). if your playing flank in rugby its ok to just wear soccer cleats because as flank you need light shoes and you need to run fast.

Although there are those few people in the world who love feeling cold, most soccer players are the same as everyone else, they prefer to do all they can to feel warm rather than staying cold. This wish to stay warm is a basic desire for most people as it makes us feel better emotionally. I’m sure most of us can identify with that.

These are the best soccer drills that teach spacing that I have used and seen great results with. Download these drills as a free PDF at the bottom of the page\nwhy is spacing important in soccer? In soccer, it is important that you encourage your team to spread out and find space when in possession of the ball, this makes it very hard for the other team to try and steal the ball back as your team will always have a teammate to pass to if they are closed down. Your team will create more attacking opportunities if players maintain their spacing as the other team will be dragged out of position, this will allow space for your players to attack and to try to score goals. If you want to speed up the development of your players the best way for you to do this is to improve your knowledge as a coach. Here are some soccer coaching books I would recommend. How do you teach a soccer player to spread out? Teaching a soccer player to spread out and stop bunching cannot be taught during one session, it must be continuously taught throughout the soccer season.","start_char":0,"end_char":1595}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_04_224000189#0_597014878","score":11.5073,"doc":{"url":"http://www.answers.com/Q/Why_is_muscular_strength_important_in_soccer","title":"Why is muscular strength important in soccer? - Answers","headings":"Why is muscular strength important in soccer\n?\n\nWhy is muscular strength important in soccer?\nYour Answer\nWhy is muscular strength important in soccer?\n","segment":"Why is muscular strength important in soccer? - Answers\nAmerican Soccer\nFootball - Soccer\nMuscular System\nWhy is muscular strength important in soccer? Asked by Wiki User\nSee Answer\nTop Answer\nWiki User\nAnswered 2013-01-29 01:05:56\nMuscular strength is important in soccer for several reasons. Primarily, muscular strength is a major component of overall fitness and athleticism, which are necessary in order to excel at the sport. Secondarily, stronger muscles often equate to a larger, heavier frame that helps prevent getting pushed around on the field. More generally, muscular players (and non-player people) are healthier overall, which is beneficial as sportsmen. Soccer players use their muscles in a variety of ways during play. Strong legs are often considered the most important, because most players (and referees) will run several miles during a match. The legs are used not only for running, but for maintaining balance, stopping and changing direction, and of course kicking the ball. A player with weak leg muscles will not be able to do any of these things very well.","start_char":0,"end_char":1084}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_45_994102615#12_1942190822","score":11.4998,"doc":{"url":"https://www.lineups.com/articles/soccer/","title":"Soccer Articles - Latest US Soccer & Premier League News","headings":"Soccer Articles\nSoccer Articles\nTop 6 Streaming Services For Soccer: Best Live Stream Options for Watching Online\n2020-2021 Premier League Rankings, Predictions and Preview\nSoccer Academy 105: World Cup 101 (Beginners Guide)\nLionel Messi Top Landing Spots: Which Team Will Messi Go To?\n2020-2021 Serie A Rankings & Preview: Juventus to Continue Domination\nSoccer Academy 104: Leagues, Teams & Tournaments\nSoccer Academy 103: Player Positions & Roles\nFact or Fiction on the Top Transfer Target for Each of the Premier League’s Top Six Sides\nSoccer Academy 102: Formations & Styles\nChampions League 101 Beginner’s Guide: How it Works\nWorldwide Organization of the Sport\nCompetitions, Awards, Teams & Players\nMatches & Leagues\nGlobal Audience\nSoccer FAQs\nWhat is soccer?\nWhy do people call soccer “football/futbol” in other countries?\nWhat is the best soccer team in the world?\nWho is the best soccer player in the world?\nWhich country is the best at soccer?\nIs the United States national team any good at soccer?\nWhy is soccer so popular?\nWhat is soccer?\nWhy do people call soccer “football/futbol” in other countries?\nWhat is the best soccer team in the world?\nWho is the best soccer player in the world?\nWhich country is the best at soccer?\nIs the United States national team any good at soccer?\nWhy is soccer so popular?\n","segment":"In league play, a team gets three points for winning, one point for drawing, and no points for losing. Each team plays every other team twice, once at home and once away. The total number of points that each team has at the end of the season then determines the winner of the league or which teams will take part in an additional playoff bracket. Larger tournaments may also have group stages. In a group stage, there will be multiple groups of teams, and teams will play the other teams in their group. Group stages use the point system, and the top teams in each group will move on to the knockout rounds that no longer use the point system and are either single elimination or a two-legged tie.

At the end of a season, soccer players take a deserved break from the game. Depending on the club, league, and team coach, that break can last from a few weeks to a few months. Although many players work hard at staying fit during this break not all players are as successful as others! To bring the entire team back up to a similar level of game fitness for when the new season starts a selection of friendly games is organized to allow the players to get used to playing together again and improve their in-game fitness levels for the many games ahead. ( To find out how many games are in a soccer season, click here to go to my article revealing the answer.)

How Far Do Soccer Players Run in a World Cup? According to the 2018 FIFA World Cup statistics, Sergio Ramos a total of 41.4 KM in four games. It means that the Real Madrid central defender movement around the field was averaging at 10.3 KM (6.4 miles) per game. Interestingly, the distance Ramos walked when possessing the ball was twice the movement he made while chasing the ball. In the 2016/17 Premier League season, Chelsea’s full-back Marcos Alonso agility was estimated to be 11.64 KM (7.2 miles) per game. The movement was considered to be massive for a defender, but it could be the reason why Alonso scored more goals than some strikers in that season. The professionals increase their speeds using techniques that standard players don’t. To give yourself that extra power when you begin your sprint, use resistance bands.

Understanding Motivation\nMotivation is important to ensure that individuals operate on a basis of commitment rather than compliance, illustrated by the Y model. Compliance usually results in the bare minimum standard and is often reluctantly given and short term.

Project managers have found it useful to share the model with their teams. It helps members accept the tensions of the storming phase, and it directs their focus to moving toward the more productive phases. Another implication of the five-stage team development model is that it stresses the importance of the norming phase, which contributes significantly to the level of productivity experienced during the performing phase. Project managers, as we shall see, have to take an active role in-shaping group norms that will contribute to ultimate project success. How to use this knowledge\nTeam Selection\nCompetence and potential will always be the first criteria for selection of individual team members, often followed by availability. However, if you want a high performing team then attention should be put onto the individuals working preferences to ensure cultural fit and balance. This can be done in a number of ways including psychometric profiling – MBTI, TMS etc there are many tools available. Selection should not be the based wholly on a profile but it is very useful when trying to choose between equally competent candidates. Early and consistent induction is vital to integration, as are regular team meetings.","start_char":3034,"end_char":4377}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_39_821163016#2_1664698329","score":13.1428,"doc":{"url":"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295716","title":"How to Build a High-Performance Team","headings":"How to Build a High-Performance Team\nHow to Build a High-Performance Team\n1.

Clearly defined roles for subgroups\nFor the sake of efficiency, members of a team often form smaller teams, or subgroups, operating in support of the larger team’s objective. Areas where subgroups often form are finance, marketing, communications and planning. It’s important to give each subgroup its own clear goal and to reinforce that it is the output of the larger team that’s most important, being careful not to let one subgroup (e.g. finance) become the tail that wags the dog. 4. Shared resources\nThe needs of the team must outweigh the need of any subgroup or individual, and so resources need to be allocated with the final objective in mind. This includes “hard” resources like money, space, equipment, tools, and people. However, the sharing of resources extends beyond that to include “soft” resources like ideas, feedback, innovative approaches, and insight.","start_char":1148,"end_char":2372}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_35_878232008#12_2086266032","score":13.1225,"doc":{"url":"https://www.careeraddict.com/competency-based-interview-questions","title":"Top 10 Competency-Based Interview Questions","headings":"Top 10 Competency-Based Interview Questions\nTop 10 Competency-Based Interview Questions\n1. ‘How have you supported a struggling colleague?’\n2. ‘Can you tell us about a time you had to deal with a challenge at work?’\n3. ‘Have you ever had to handle an angry customer?’\n4. ‘Would you bring about change in the company?

This can result in a work environment where teams compete with each other — instead of their business’s actual competitors. As noted in Harvard Business Review, workplace tribalism creates an “us versus them” mentality, producing a culture where people are less likely to be focused on overcoming business challenges together. Team productivity suffers. When team leads don’t see eye to eye, they might proceed with a plan that either duplicates or counteracts the work of another department. Siloed teams protect their own team’s interests over those of the organization, which hurts consistency, reliability, and collaboration. Related\n[Infographic] How Much Time Are You Wasting on Siloed Information?

A skills matrix is a visual tool that identifies the key skills needed in each department and then recognises our team members and their level of competency against these skills. A good skills matrix can start the conversation about each person’s confidence with the tasks needed. From here a training plan can be created to cross train your team members, providing job variety and a robust team that can still perform at the same level, even when people are away. Why is a Skills Matrix Important? Developing a skill matrix is important as it focuses conversations on how work is completed and the basic skills needed to complete the tasks that contribute to the work in each department. This ties in well with developing standard work. Once the key skills are identified, we can check our current team for their level of competency and use the opportunity to correct any bad habits that have crept in through the “Chinese whispers” method of training, where each person just shows the next person how they do it and it slowly gets modified over time, often losing the critical elements of quality and safety along the way. A skills matrix also helps our new team leaders by clearly indicating who has the skills to carry out a job correctly and whether they are competent to do this unsupervised or if they need assistance. Welcoming new people into a team can be made easier with a skills matrix, as it shows the key tasks completed in the department and gives them an understanding of the way each department works.","start_char":871,"end_char":2416}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_43_496760535#4_1091857380","score":12.7973,"doc":{"url":"https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/18/03/competency-framework.pdf","title":"","headings":"The Competency Framework\nThe\n \nCompetency\n \nFramework\n\n\n \nguide\n \nfor\n \nIAEA\n \nmanagers\n \nand\n \nstaff\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhat\n \nis\n \na\n \ncompetency\n \nframework?\n \n\nWhat\n \nare\n \nthe\n \ncomponents\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nframework?\n\nWhat\n \nare\n \ncompetencies?\n\nWhy\n \nuse\n \ncompetencies?\n\nHow\n \nare\n \nthe\n \ncompetencies\n \nbeing\n \nused\n \nand\n \nsupported?\n\nPlanning\n\nHow\n \nwas\n \nthe\n \nAgency’s\n \ncompetency\n \nframework\n \ndeveloped?\n\nWhat\n \nis\n \nthe\n \nway\n \nforward?\n\n1.\n \nCORE\n \nVALUES\n \n\n2.\n \nCORE\n \nCOMPETENCIES\n \n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nTEAMWORK\n\nPLANNING\n \nAND\n \nORGANIZING\n \n\nACHIEVING\n \nRESULTS\n\n3.\n \nFUNCTIONAL\n \nCOMPETENCIES\n\nLEADING\n \nAND\n \nSUPERVISING\n\nANALYTICAL\n \nTHINKING\n\nKNOWLEDGE\n \nSHARING\n \nAND\n \nLEARNING\n\nJUDGEMENT/DECISION\n \nMAKING\n\nTECHNICAL\n \n/SCIENTIFIC\n \nCREDIBILITY\n\nCHANGE\n \nMANAGEMENT\n \n\nCOMMITMENT\n \nTO\n \nCONTINUOUS\n \nPROCESS\n \nIMPROVEMENT\n\nPARTNERSHIP\n \nBUILDING\n\nCLIENT\n \nORIENTATION\n\nPERSUASION\n \nAND\n \nINFLUENCING\n\nRESILIENCE\n\nThe\n \nCompetency\n \nFramework\n\n","segment":"The\n \ncompetency\n \nframework\n \nconsists\n \nof\n \nthree\n \noccupational\n \nroles\n \nfor\n \nthe\n \ncore\n \ncompetencies\n \nand\n \nfour\n \noccupational\n \nroles\n \nfor\n \nthe\n \nfunctional\n \ncompetencies.

Reserve teams often include back-up players from the first team, young players who need playing time to improve their skills, as well as members of the first team recovering from injury. In some countries, reserve or development teams compete in entirely separate competitions from first teams, while some countries allow reserve teams or farm teams to compete in the same league system as their club's first team, although usually in separate divisions.

When used as the basis for the talent lifecycle, they can also be effective in maintaining consistency. Skills can be learned, but in most cases, competencies are intrinsic to the individual’s personality.

Reserve teams often include back-up players from the first team, young players who need playing time to improve their skills, as well as members of the first team recovering from injury. In some countries, reserve or development teams compete in entirely separate competitions from first teams, while some countries allow reserve teams or farm teams to compete in the same league system as their club's first team, although usually in separate divisions.","start_char":453,"end_char":1788}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_55_502179404#10_1148577832","score":12.6809,"doc":{"url":"https://www.thoughtfulleader.com/skills-matrix/","title":"How to Create a Skills Matrix and Improve Your Team - Thoughtful Leader","headings":"How to Create a Skills Matrix and Improve Your Team\nHow to Create a Skills Matrix and Improve Your Team\nHow to Create a Skills Matrix (or Competency Matrix)\nStep 1.

Use your Skills Matrix to improve accountability\nYou may notice on your Skills Matrix that some people have multiple relevant skills, where others only use a few in their role. This will give you an idea of the specialists and generalists in your team. You may be able to delegate accountability for key team tasks to a technical specialist to play a lead role in their chosen area. This will take some workload off you and give your team members a chance to step up and play a bigger part in the team. This can often lead to better outcomes because specific team members will begin to take ownership of key team functions and make sure they are functioning well. 4. Use your Skills Matrix to justify additional resourcing\nA skills or competency matrix can be a great tool if you plan to hire more resources in your team, especially if you need to justify it to senior management. If you can show where you have skill gaps or a single point of failure in your team, you may have a better chance of bringing on new people to reduce the risk. Sometimes the exercise of visualising the skills in your team using the Skills Matrix can highlight problems better than just using words.","start_char":4513,"end_char":5696}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_13_1198392771#10_2690576679","score":12.658,"doc":{"url":"https://caccapl.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/web/repository/discussion-guides/leaders-eat-last-discussion-guide.pdf","title":"","headings":"SMA’s

The average John Q. Public doesn’t call me because he thinks our teams aren’t having enough fun. That means that we need to get our athletes as good as we can get them, put our best athletes on a team together, and coach the heck out of them. In order to do this, we try to clearly define our competitive levels. For our Varsity team, our coaches select the athletes who they believe will give the team the best opportunity to compete on any given night. It’s important to note that this doesn’t necessarily mean the team consists of the most talented individuals. Sometimes, an athlete blessed with talent has difficulty fitting a specific role on the team and needs more time to grow within a team concept.

Therefore, it is valuable to assess the way in which the importance of specific project manager skills and competencies is impacted by these changes. Project Characteristics\nThe environment within which the project manager works is impacted by the type of project being managed, or the characteristics of the project as well as the business environment, team characteristics, and other factors. However, the impact of these on elements of projects (e.g., team composition and project manager selection) is frequently not taken into consideration. Specifically, as outlined above, it is assumed in many areas of the literature—as reflected by the static nature of lists of project manager skills and competencies— that all projects involve the same work and can be managed most effectively with the same project manager skills and competencies. While project characteristics are not consistently examined, some authors do take into consideration the impact of such factors as the business environment and project characteristics, and have created classification systems. Shenhar (2001), for example, used technological uncertainty to differentiate among project types. Others have also considered characteristics as a way by which to better understand the needs of the project. Rad and Levin (2003) evaluated project manager and team member skills as a way to identify an organization’s friendliness towards projects. In general, when project characteristics are used as a way by which to classify projects, a very small number (often one) are included.","start_char":7861,"end_char":9466}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_32_1677478639#9_3677414683","score":12.5533,"doc":{"url":"https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/create-skills-matrix-competency-matrix/","title":"How to Create a Skills Matrix for Success | Competency Matrix","headings":"How to Create a Skills Matrix for Success\nHow to Create a Skills Matrix for Success\nWhat is a skills matrix?\nWhat is a skills matrix used for?\nBenefits of a skills matrix\nSteps involved in creating a competency matrix\n1.

Moreover, critics argue that TFA compromises teaching as a profession by minimizing the importance of preservice preparation and casting teaching as a prelude to the higher-status careers that many corps members enter after their TFA experience. Some cynically assert that the program functions primarily as a résumé booster for ambitious upper-middle-class college graduates, intent on fashioning the most compelling application to the nation’s top law or medical schools. Debates about whether TFA can revive chronically failing schools or will further aggravate the problems facing these schools often turn on competing claims about how long TFA teachers stay on the job. Critics conclude that corps members routinely leave their school after their two-year commitment, if not before. For their part, TFA relies on internal surveys, which show that 60% of corps members remain in education, holding various roles at various levels of the system. Until now, however, solid information about how long TFA teachers actually remain in teaching and in their low-income schools has not been available to policy makers and school officials. Our large-scale, nationwide analysis of TFA teacher turnover presents a more detailed picture of which TFAers stay, which ones leave the profession and some suggestions about why they leave. In our study, we learned: Nearly two-thirds (60.5%) of TFA teachers continue as public school teachers beyond their two-year commitment.","start_char":1696,"end_char":3487}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_34_256018216#4_547193511","score":12.4705,"doc":{"url":"https://www.best-job-interview.com/accountant-interview-questions.html","title":"Accountant Interview Questions and Answers Guide","headings":"Accountant Interview Questions -\nCompetency Requirements\n\nAccountant Interview Questions -\nCompetency Requirements\nKnowledge requirements\nAccountant Interview Questions - competency requirements\nBehavioral Accountant Interview Questions\n1.

To expect certain behavior from your team, you have to first act out the behavior consistently first before you have the right to speak and preach about it. For example, you should not be going around preaching about being on time for meetings if you are constantly late for your own meetings.

What happens without accountability in the workplace? A lack of accountability in the workplace damages the entire team. If people are showing up late, missing deadlines, submitting subpar work, and so on, on a regular basis, these poor work practices begin to become the norm. Especially in the current business climate, many employees are likely falling short of previous expectations. This could be because of unfamiliarity in working remotely, or even a newfound sense of autonomy that comes from initiative-based work. However, if employees who fall short of organizational expectations are not consistently held accountable for their mistakes, it sends a message to other employees that their behaviors can be excused.

Soft skills refer to a cluster of personal traits, including your work ethic, your personality, your social graces, your attitude, your communication skills, and a host of other personal attributes that are crucial for success in business.\nSoft skills are also known as interpersonal skills, social skills, and people skills. Soft skills enhance an employees relationships and performance on the job; and individuals who posses these soft skills are highly sought after and valued in the workplace.\nFollowing are 10 soft skills you need to be successful in business:\nBe interested in others and the world around you. People like people who are interested in them and the world around them, not just in themselves. “Your goal is to make others feel comfortable around you by focusing on them; and you can influence people’s perceptions of you by playing to their needs,” writes Camille Lavington in “You’ve Got Three Seconds.” Knowing what is going on in the world will not only make you appear less egocentric, but it will also equip you with conversation topics for everyone with whom you come into contact.\nBe a good listener and ask questions.“Research has consistently demonstrated that ineffective listening habits present the most common barriers to success in relationships and careers,” according to Larry Barker and Kittie Watson, authors of “Listen Up.” People like to know they are being heard and that their ideas are appreciated. By being a good listener, you let others know that you value them and what they have to say. Etiquette expert Letitia Baldridge says, “Politeness decrees that you must listen to be kind; intelligence decrees that you must listen to learn.”\nBe skilled at relationship management. “Relationship management is your ability to use your awareness of your own emotions and those of others to manage interactions successfully,” according to Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves, authors of “Emotional Intelligence 2.0.” People like to work with people they like, trust, and feel understand them. Today’s workplace can be very stressful; but when you are skilled at relationship management, you can more effectively work with your team members to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges and obstacles to achieve a win-win scenario for all, which is what good leaders seek to accomplish.\nBe good natured; have a sense of humor. Be positive; try to make the best of situations; and don’t take yourself too seriously. A judicious and tasteful sense of humor can often deflate tense situations; and studies show having a sense of humor can help you get ahead at work. A Robert Half survey, for instance, found that 91% of executives believe a sense of humor is important for career advancement; while 84% feel that people with a good sense of humor do a better job. Another study by Bell Leadership Institute found that the two most desirable traits in leaders were a strong work ethic and a good sense of humor.\n“A sense of humor is the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done.” -Dwight D. Eisenhower\nBe a team player. “We’re all in this together; and let’s make it work” is an attitude that is appreciated by everyone. To paraphrase Harvard professor David Deming in his paper “The Growing Importance of Social Skills in the Labor Market,” “As work is becoming more team-oriented, workers with strong soft skills are more able to work well with others and will be considered more valuable, since good teamwork increases productivity.” Being on a team often requires flexibility, especially in today’s fast-paced work environment. Be ready to “shift gears” if necessary for the good of the team and project at-hand.\nBe polished. Your appearance remains one of the main factors that will encourage others to work with and for you. It is important, not only in first impressions, but also in ongoing interactions. It is the filter through which your talent, suitability, and communication skills will be evaluated. According to a research study by senior managers in the U.S.A., polish is by far the most important aspect of appearance. Polish your appearance for success!\nBe confident. “Confidence is important because it is the most attractive personal brand attribute. When someone exudes confidence, we want to work with them; we are more likely to follow their lead,” says William Arruda, personal branding expert. And, “Employers will know they can trust you with a project and that you are likely going to be good at motivating others as well,” according to Dr. Katharine Brooks, author of “You Majored in What? Your Path from Chaos to Career.\n“Fake it until you become it.” Amy Cuddy, author of “Presence”\nBe an effective communicator. Communication skills are some of the most important skills you will need to succeed in the workplace. “First communication is not so much what you say, but rather how you say it. And this you can condition and control,” according to Sylvania Ann Hewlett, author of “Executive Presence.” Your words and your body language must be congruent to be believable.\nFurthermore, in order to be an effective communicator, you must understand what your message is, what audience you are sending it to, and how it will be perceived. If is it not perceived the way you intended it be perceived, you did not effectively communicate your message.\nBe skilled at making small talk. Small talk “breaks the ice;” it makes others feel comfortable and puts them at ease. It is the first level of a conversation; it is about the current situation, how you got there, the weather, the location, mutual friends or other connections, such as sports, your pets, or your children. When you work in an office environment, making small talk and socializing with team members is essential for building rapport with them.\nBe polite and treat everyone with respect. Good manners will be noticed and approved of, just as poor manners will work against one. Having good manners and a respectful attitude toward others will make people want to be around you, in and out of\nthe office.\n“Civility lifts perceptions of warmth and competence. Civility lifts people,” writes Christine Porath in her “New York Times” article (6/19/15) “No Time to Be Nice at Work.”\nBy: Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick\nFebruary 15, 2016\n","segment":"Be skilled at making small talk.

Affiliative Leadership\nGoleman describes this style as ‘building relationships, close communication, showing empathy’ so an affiliative style creates a harmonious atmosphere when working through stressful conditions and circumstances.

Hollywood producers and magazine editors love tales of inner-city kids defeating private-school students in chess tournaments, but often, when you look a little more closely at the triumphs, they aren’t quite as inspiring as they originally seemed. Sometimes the tournament that the team from the disadvantaged neighborhood won turns out to be a minor one, or the division that the students were competing in was restricted to students below a certain ability rating. Or the low-income kids turn out to be somehow atypical — they go to a selective school with an entrance exam, or they’re recent immigrants from Asia or Eastern Europe rather than black or Latino kids from families with long poverty histories. In 2005, to give one example, New York magazine ran a long, adulatory profile of the chess team from the Mott Hall School, known as the Dark Knights of Harlem, “a hard-charging bunch of 10-to-12-year-olds from Washington Heights, Inwood, and Harlem” who were competing in a national tournament in Nashville. They did come in second in their division of the sixth-grade tournament, which was a fine achievement—but they were competing in the under-1000 section, meaning they didn’t play anybody with a rating over 1000, which is fairly low. And the students had all had to pass an entrance exam to get into Mott Hall, so they were above average to begin with. Plus the team, while technically from Harlem, had only one black player; almost all the others were immigrants born in Kosovo or Poland or Mexico or Ecuador or China.

Finally, being part of a team, a leader should be able to take responsibility, recognize and acknowledge the achievements of team members and inspire others by their own example. Each of these 10 leadership competency examples can greatly affect how a leader is able to perform inside your organization. It also impacts the direct value they drive in their interactions with workforce they are leading.","start_char":7645,"end_char":9159}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_01_651431333#13_626570340","score":12.2162,"doc":{"url":"http://etiquette-ny.com/the-top10-soft-skills-to-cultivate-for-success-in-business/","title":"10 Soft Skills You Need to Be Successful in Business | Etiquette School of New York","headings":"\nWhile your technical skills may help you get your foot in the door, it will be your polished soft skills that will enable you to land jobs, get promotions, win clients, and successfully launch a new business.\nBut what are soft skills? Soft skills refer to a cluster of personal traits, including your work ethic, your personality, your social graces, your attitude, your communication skills, and a host of other personal attributes that are crucial for success in business.\nSoft skills are also known as interpersonal skills, social skills, and people skills. Soft skills enhance an employees relationships and performance on the job; and individuals who posses these soft skills are highly sought after and valued in the workplace.\nFollowing are 10 soft skills you need to be successful in business:\nBe interested in others and the world around you. People like people who are interested in them and the world around them, not just in themselves. “Your goal is to make others feel comfortable around you by focusing on them; and you can influence people’s perceptions of you by playing to their needs,” writes Camille Lavington in “You’ve Got Three Seconds.” Knowing what is going on in the world will not only make you appear less egocentric, but it will also equip you with conversation topics for everyone with whom you come into contact.\nBe a good listener and ask questions.“Research has consistently demonstrated that ineffective listening habits present the most common barriers to success in relationships and careers,” according to Larry Barker and Kittie Watson, authors of “Listen Up.” People like to know they are being heard and that their ideas are appreciated. By being a good listener, you let others know that you value them and what they have to say. Etiquette expert Letitia Baldridge says, “Politeness decrees that you must listen to be kind; intelligence decrees that you must listen to learn.”\nBe skilled at relationship management. “Relationship management is your ability to use your awareness of your own emotions and those of others to manage interactions successfully,” according to Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves, authors of “Emotional Intelligence 2.0.” People like to work with people they like, trust, and feel understand them. Today’s workplace can be very stressful; but when you are skilled at relationship management, you can more effectively work with your team members to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges and obstacles to achieve a win-win scenario for all, which is what good leaders seek to accomplish.\nBe good natured; have a sense of humor. Be positive; try to make the best of situations; and don’t take yourself too seriously. A judicious and tasteful sense of humor can often deflate tense situations; and studies show having a sense of humor can help you get ahead at work. A Robert Half survey, for instance, found that 91% of executives believe a sense of humor is important for career advancement; while 84% feel that people with a good sense of humor do a better job. Another study by Bell Leadership Institute found that the two most desirable traits in leaders were a strong work ethic and a good sense of humor.\n“A sense of humor is the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done.” -Dwight D. Eisenhower\nBe a team player. “We’re all in this together; and let’s make it work” is an attitude that is appreciated by everyone. To paraphrase Harvard professor David Deming in his paper “The Growing Importance of Social Skills in the Labor Market,” “As work is becoming more team-oriented, workers with strong soft skills are more able to work well with others and will be considered more valuable, since good teamwork increases productivity.” Being on a team often requires flexibility, especially in today’s fast-paced work environment. Be ready to “shift gears” if necessary for the good of the team and project at-hand.\nBe polished. Your appearance remains one of the main factors that will encourage others to work with and for you. It is important, not only in first impressions, but also in ongoing interactions. It is the filter through which your talent, suitability, and communication skills will be evaluated. According to a research study by senior managers in the U.S.A., polish is by far the most important aspect of appearance. Polish your appearance for success!\nBe confident. “Confidence is important because it is the most attractive personal brand attribute. When someone exudes confidence, we want to work with them; we are more likely to follow their lead,” says William Arruda, personal branding expert. And, “Employers will know they can trust you with a project and that you are likely going to be good at motivating others as well,” according to Dr. Katharine Brooks, author of “You Majored in What? Your Path from Chaos to Career.\n“Fake it until you become it.” Amy Cuddy, author of “Presence”\nBe an effective communicator. Communication skills are some of the most important skills you will need to succeed in the workplace. “First communication is not so much what you say, but rather how you say it. And this you can condition and control,” according to Sylvania Ann Hewlett, author of “Executive Presence.” Your words and your body language must be congruent to be believable.\nFurthermore, in order to be an effective communicator, you must understand what your message is, what audience you are sending it to, and how it will be perceived. If is it not perceived the way you intended it be perceived, you did not effectively communicate your message.\nBe skilled at making small talk. Small talk “breaks the ice;” it makes others feel comfortable and puts them at ease. It is the first level of a conversation; it is about the current situation, how you got there, the weather, the location, mutual friends or other connections, such as sports, your pets, or your children. When you work in an office environment, making small talk and socializing with team members is essential for building rapport with them.\nBe polite and treat everyone with respect. Good manners will be noticed and approved of, just as poor manners will work against one. Having good manners and a respectful attitude toward others will make people want to be around you, in and out of\nthe office.\n“Civility lifts perceptions of warmth and competence. Civility lifts people,” writes Christine Porath in her “New York Times” article (6/19/15) “No Time to Be Nice at Work.”\nBy: Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick\nFebruary 15, 2016\n","segment":"When you work in an office environment, making small talk and socializing with team members is essential for building rapport with them.

What did you do to build the team spirit? Were you the project coordinator? Perhaps the project ran based on your strategy? Let the employer know what an active and cooperative team member you are with a sample answer like, ‘I considered my team members’ ideas and proposals, was always open to their concerns, and I made sure to give honest and constructive feedback so as to avoid conflict.

The report also introduced new scientific evidence that the agency said suggested Armstrong was doping the last two times he competed in the Tour de France. “It has been a frequent refrain of Armstrong and his representatives over the years that Lance Armstrong has never had a positive drug test,” the report said. “ That does not mean, however, he did not dope. Nor has Armstrong apparently had nearly as many doping tests as his representatives have claimed.” As part of its investigation, Usada asked Christopher J. Gore, the head of physiology at the Australian Institute of Sport, to analyze test results from 38 blood samples taken from Armstrong between February 2009 and the end of last April. Those taken during the 2009 and 2010 Tours, the report said, showed blood values whose likelihood “of occurring naturally was less than one in a million,” and other indications of blood doping. While Gore’s analysis was not a conventional antidoping test, Usada concluded that the findings “build a compelling argument consistent with blood doping.” The techniques Usada says were used by Armstrong and his teammates to elude positive tests were used by many cyclists, and many believe those tactics are still in use today. They often exploited weaknesses in the antidoping system, many of which still persist.","start_char":1152,"end_char":2651}},{"docid":"msmarco_v2.1_doc_58_614233257#11_745321320","score":12.1953,"doc":{"url":"https://www.wikijob.co.uk/content/interview-advice/competencies/teamwork","title":"Teamwork Skills: 5 Good Teamwork Skills (Great For Resume)","headings":"Teamwork Skills\nTeamwork Skills\nIn this article Skip to section\nWhat Do Employers Mean by Teamwork?\nWhy Are Teamwork Skills So Highly Valued?\nTypes of Teamwork Skills\nTop 5 Teamwork Skills You Need to Learn\nCommunication Skills\nSupport Skills\nProblem-Solving Skills\nListening and Feedback Skills\nConflict Management Skills\nExample Teamwork Competency Questions\nTips and Examples for Answering Teamwork Questions\nTiming\nSituation\nHobbies\nFinal Thoughts\n","segment":"Tell me about a situation when you needed to offer constructive criticism to a friend or team member? Tips and Examples for Answering Teamwork Questions\nWhen it comes to answering teamwork questions, try to keep your answers grounded in real situations of which you have actual experience. Timing\nMany interviewees tend to either drag on with their answers, or make their answers too short due to nerves, meaning they miss out on key points or information relating to their answer. Try to ensure that your answers are between three and five minutes long and include only the most relevant information to your ability to work successfully within a team. Situation\nTry to make sure the situation you were in when describing your answer is as unique and as relevant as possible. The best situations will include positions where you were the leader of a team and listened to the other team members, then used their information and feedback to help develop your own situation. This will show that not only can you work in a team effectively, but also that you are willing to listen to the feedback of others to improve your own work, something which is often difficult for others. Another useful scenario is one where you resolved conflict with another team member. Ideally this will show how you resolved the conflict professionally without letting your emotions get the better of you, and without involving HR to resolve the matter for you. Hobbies\nMost examples you will use in answering teamwork questions will be from your extracurricular activities.","start_char":6242,"end_char":7793}}]}
